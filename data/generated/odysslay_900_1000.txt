Listen up, y'all, to a tale so bold
Of a queen named Penelope, so smart and so cold
She be thinking 'bout ways to get rid of the crowd
Of suitors who, all day, shouting aloud

Minerva came through and whispered, you see,
"Make 'em compete with bow and axe, oh-so-freely"
She went upstairs to get the key so right
Bronze with ivory handle, shiny and bright

To the store room they went, right at the end of the house
Where treasures and weapons, no need to espouse
Including a bow and quiver, truly grand
Gifted by Iphitus, a legendary man

Ulysses and Iphitus, they be like peas in a pod
Met as dudes, tried to reclaim horses, a trip kinda odd
But Hercules, his power like a bomb
Killed Iphitus, didn't care about the bond

From Iphitus, Ulysses got a bow, so rare
A friendship so true, beyond compare
Used it at home, never took it to Troy
Left it as a keepsake, all sentimental and coy

As Penelope approached the suitors' site,
Her tears were falling, there was no light.
But with her, she carried a strong bow,
And a quiver of arrows, deadly like wow.

Her maidens trailed behind her with grace,
Holding a chest filled with iron and bronze to embrace.
As she stood before the suitors, filled with dread,
She held a veil before her face as she said:

"Which one of you brave men will string this bow?
And shoot an arrow, straight and slow?
My husband did it with ease in the past,
But alas, he's gone and this chance won't last."

The suitors scoffed, thinking they were tough,
They tried to string it, but it was far too rough.
Then out of nowhere, a stranger appeared,
And with one swift movement, the bow was reared.

'Cause our mystery guest was none other than Odysseus,
Who showed the suitors who the real boss is.
With his bow and arrow, he tore them apart,
And reclaimed his throne with a warrior's heart. 

In the end, Penelope was joyous and relieved,
That her true love had finally achieved,
Peace in his castle, and love in his heart,
Forever and ever, and that's a true art.

Yo, suitors, you won't believe it's true
Just trying to marry me for a few
You're all abusing the hospitality of this place
But I got news for you, you should save face

To win my heart, a challenge you'll face
The mighty bow of Ulysses is the case
String it easily, send the arrow through each axe
And I'll marry whoever's skill makes the best tracks

I'll ditch this house from my lawful spouse
And follow the one who owns the house
But in my dreams, I'll remember and gleam
About the one who wins with the best dream

Oh snap, Antinous thinks he's so slick,
But he and his suitors are in for a trick.
The queen has spoken, her orders were clear,
Eumaeus wept, he wasn't able to cheer.

The stockman cried too, when he saw the bow,
Antinous scolded them, acting like a big wow.
He called them "silly simpletons", acting like a tool,
But we know who the real fool is, that's the rule.

He ain't no match for Ulysses, that's for sure,
The suitors will see when they try to endure.
Stringing that bow is no easy feat,
They'll be sweating and grunting to complete.

So come on Antinous, bring your A-game,
But we all know that you're not the same.
Ulysses was the king of this land,
And no one can step up to his command.

Oh my gosh, can you even believe
What this guy is trying to achieve?
He's dissing Ulysses in his own crib,
Encouraging others to be so glib.

But little did he know or expect,
That out of his house he'd be so quickly checked.
Ulysses is a true king with a bow so strong,
His shots will leave you singing a woeful song.

This dude thought he had it all figured out,
But Ulysses proved him wrong, no doubt.
He was the first to get an arrow in the face,
A lesson learned, don't mess with Ulysses' grace.

Now, let's take a moment to recognize,
That Ulysses is the real prize.
He'll always defend his honor and name,
And defeat his enemies in the ultimate game. 

#OopsIDidUseAHashtag #MyBad #MyRhymesAreSoSick #LitFam #Slay #YasQueen #HipHopHooray #NewMemeWhoDis #UlyssesIsKing #BowDown #Respect

Telemachus spoke, his words were loud and clear,
Jove must have robbed him of his senses, oh dear!
His mother, she wants to remarry,
But Telemachus is here, all merry.

The suitors, they've agreed upon a test,
To see who can shoot the arrow best,
For a woman fair and true,
Whose equal cannot be found, it's true.

Telemachus, he'll show them all,
He won't let his mother fall,
He'll try to shoot the arrow too,
And win the prizes his father knew.

Let's get this show on the road,
No need for delays, let's unload,
The bow and arrow, and let's see,
Who's the best archer, it's time to claim victory.

Yo, he rose from his seat with a mighty spring,
Threw off his cloak, took his sword and everything.
He set the axes straight, made a groove in the ground,
Tamped it tight and everyone was like "wow" out loud.

Then he went to the pavement to try the bow,
Pulled as hard as he could, but it wouldn't go.
He tried it thrice, with all his might and main,
But had to stop, though he hoped for a different gain.

On the fourth try, he almost did succeed,
But Ulysses stopped him with great lead.
He made a sign to halt all the action,
Saying "We have a test of another fashion."

Yo, listen up, this dude is feeling quite unsure,
Either he's weak or just too young to endure.
He throws the bow, feeling quite incomplete,
But he's right, his strength hasn't reached its peak.

To all the others, this is your chance,
Show off your strength, show off your dance.
Make trial of the bow, let's settle this score,
Whoever wins, we'll cheer for evermore.

So come on, flex those muscles and show us your might,
Give us something to tweet about all night.
Let's see who's got the skills, who's got the game,
And let's hope this contest ends in sweet sweet fame.

Yo yo yo, hold up a sec,
Let me tell you 'bout this neck wreck.
Odysseus with the moves so sly,
Antinous ready to ask him why.

Odysseus puts his bow down,
Antinous gives him a frown.
But our boy just chills on his throne
Ready to call this world his own.

"Who gave you permission to touch the bow?"
Antinous tries to flex, but we all know
Odysseus can best him in a fight
Just like when Drake killed Meek Mill's career that night.

Okay okay okay, let's get lit
Everybody take a sip, don't quit
Pass it to the right, gotta keep it tight
Like a game of hot potato, don't fight

The cupbearer leads the way, like a boss
We gotta follow, no matter the cost
Take a deep breath, take a step
Pass that cup, but don't spill and let it drip

It's like a ritual, a tradition so old
Just like that viral meme that never gets old
But instead of likes, we pass the wine
And keep the party going until we feel fine

Leiodes tried to string the bow,
But his weak hands just couldn't go.
He sat in the corner, filled with hate,
For the suitors' evil deeds, he couldn't relate.

He went up to make the trial,
But his strength couldn't go the mile.
He said, "My friends, I cannot swing,
Let another give this bow a fling.

This bow shall take the life and soul,
Out of many a chief who once were whole.
For it's better to die than to miss,
The prize that's brought us here, I insist.

Some of us hope and pray,
To marry Penelope in every way.
But if you want her hand in matrimony,
This bow is your one and only.

So woo another woman with your charm,
And let Penelope fall into another's arms.
But whoever wins her must make the best offer,
For this bow's power is the perfect coffer."

"Oh no he didn't just leave his bow leaning, like he's got no feelings! Hating on my man like he's some kind of villain, you best step back and sit stillin'."

Telemachus replied with a smirk and a grin, "Sorry man, I didn't mean to cause such a spin. But this bow is more than just a simple toy, it's a symbol of power, it brings me joy."

Antinous rolled his eyes, looking quite annoyed, "You're just a little boy, you're not a royal decoy. You'll never be king, don't even try to sing. Give us the bow now, or we'll make you feel the pow."

But Telemachus stood tall, not afraid to brawl, "I'm done with your lies, your tricks and your gall. I'll show you all that I can be, just wait and see." 

And with a confident nod, he picked up the bow with pride. Ready to show everyone, that he won't just hide.

Yo, Odysseus, hear me out
Your words, they just bring me doubt
"Monstrous and intolerable"?
That just ain't relatable

You're mad 'cause I can't bend this bow
But, bro, you should know by now
I wasn't born to be an archer
But there are others who are a lot sharper

This bow ain't worthy of claim
It's just fanning your ego flame
Why risk many a chief's life
When there's more to gain with less strife?

Let's put down this ancient weapon
And opt for a more modern selection
Like a team, we can conquer all
And make sure every boss takes the fall

Ayo, listen up, Melanthius my dude,  
You gotta light a fire, don't be rude  
Get a sheep skin seat for us to chill  
And bring some lard, yeah that's the drill  

We'll warm up and grease the bow with care  
Then we'll test it out, let's see what's fair  
The contest will end, all eyes on us  
So let's get lit, and make no fuss  

As the cool kids say, YOLO, right?  
We gotta do this, with all our might  
So let's get started, don't be slow  
We'll finish strong, and steal the show  

And speaking of stealing, mind the flocks  
Or you'll be catching hands, that's the rocks  
But I trust you, don't make me wrong  
Now let's get back to this bow song.  

Yeet!

Oh dang, the suitors be trying,
But their strength ain't satisfying,
Melanthius had them warm the bow,
Yet still their efforts fell very low.

Antinous and Eurymachus remain,
They won't give up and call it a game,
The ringleaders of this whole pursuit,
They won't stop until they get the loot.

But let's be real, they won't succeed,
Their attempts are sad, they don't proceed,
They need some muscles, some real might,
Maybe then they can win the fight.

Until then, they just can't cope,
Not even with the power of the dope,
It's time for a new plan of action,
The suitors need to find some traction.

But until then, they sit and wait,
Trying to string the bow, their ultimate fate,
In the end, it's clear to see,
Only Odysseus is the one who's key.

Hold up, hold up, let me intervene,
I've been lost on this island, you know what I mean?
I'm tryna get back home, to the place where I rule,
And I could use some help, if that's cool with you, fool.

The swineherd and stockman were taken aback,
"This dude talks so strange," they silently quacked,
But despite their apprehension, they decided to aid,
And lead him away from the cloisters' shade.

Ulysses was grateful, he nodded and smiled,
And they walked for a while, every step versatile,
Until Ulysses whispered, with a sense of elation,
"Thank you, my dudes, for the sweet navigation."

Yo, yo, yo, what's good, Stockman and Swineherd too?
Your girl, Athena, has got some real talk for you.
I'm debating whether or not to spill the tea,
So just sit tight and listen up to me. 

If Ulysses came back, would you be on his side,
Or would you stay with the suitors and their lies?
It's time to choose, are you real or fake?
'Cause Athena doesn't have time for those who can't keep it straight. 

Would you be like, "Bye Felicia" to the suitors for sure,
Stand with Odysseus and make his welcome pure,
'Cause if you're not, I guess you're just a basic troll,
And it'll be time for you to go back to your hole. 

So what's it gonna be, the suitors or the man,
'Cause Athena's tired of this endless stand?
Make the right choice and you might get a high five,
Make the wrong one and you'll be left with only bye-bye. 

#sorrynotsorry #choosewisely #AthenaOut.

Yo, Father Jove, mighty and high
Please hear the stockman's battle cry
If only some god could bring back Ulysses
We'd fight for him with all our stresses

With might and main, we'd go all out
And show those foes what we're about
Bring back our hero, make it quick
We'll use our skills to do the trick 

Like gods on earth, we'll stand up tall
And make our enemies take a hard fall
So please, oh please, won't you hear our plea?
Bring back Ulysses, so we can be free. 

#BringBackUlysses #StockmanSquad #FatherJoveBlessedUs

Yo, Eumaeus was praying mad hard,
Hoping and wishing that Ulysses would come back unscarred.
Then Ulysses himself stepped up to the plate,
Saying, "It's me, guys, I'm finally returning, no need to debate."

Only two of his servants were hyped to see him back,
The other ones must've had some serious swack.
So Ulysses promised a bright future ahead,
Wives, homes, and siblings, all in good stead.

To prove his identity, he showed them his boar scar,
The one he got hunting, man that was bizarre.

Hold up, fam, let's not be sad,
This ain't a funeral, it ain't so bad.
I know you miss Ulysses and all he brought,
But I'm right here, and I ain't forgot.

Look at this scar, it tells a tale,
Of my long journey, I did prevail.
And now I'm back, standing strong,
Ready to right every wrong.

So let's wipe away those tears,
And overcome all of our fears.
With Ulysses' memory in our heart,
We'll make a brand new start.

Just like that meme, "Keep calm and carry on",
We'll keep moving forward from dusk 'til dawn.
So let's embrace like true homies do,
And make sure that Ulysses is proud of me and you.

Chill out and stop the tear droppin',
Lest someone catches us moppin'.
When we go up, no need to be clingin',
We gotta play it cool and not be singin'.

I'll go in first and act like a boss,
You'll follow me, and avoid any loss.
Here's the secret sign, listen clear,
If my plan fails, we'll be in fear.

The suitors will try to stop my goal,
Of grabbing the bow, and taking control.
So Eumaeus, my boy, place it in my hand,
And tell those ladies to take their stand.

If there's a ruckus, don't come out,
Stay in your place, don't scream or shout.
Philoetius, my man, lock the doors,
Protect our crew, and secure all floors.

Yo, yo, yo, listen up, this is a story that's gonna be lit,
Our main character has just made a quick split,
He bounced back to his house without a single sound,
And his servants trailed along, looking pretty astound.

The way he rolled in, he took that seat like a boss,
Making his presence known, without any loss.
Then came his servants, following his lead,
Wondering what kind of plan this boss had up his sleeve.

This story's got potential, it's gonna be rad,
Like the memes we share that make us all so glad,
So sit tight, get ready, coz' there's more to come,
This boss is just getting started, and we'll spill the outcome.

Yo, peeps listen up, it's crazy to think
Eurymachus tried, but his bow wouldn't link
He was heated, stressed, and full of grief,
For he couldn't string it, no matter the belief

He sighed real deep, and spoke from his heart,
"I'm not sad 'bout the wedding, cuz that's just a part
Of life that I'll forget in a day or two,
What really hits me is that we're so weak and untrue

Compared to Ulysses, we're just small fry,
Can't even string his bow, which makes us wanna cry
It's shameful, embarrassing, a stain on our name,
This will haunt our descendants and bring them great shame." 

But don't worry, peeps, we've got time to train,
We'll get stronger and better, and won't feel the pain
So let's pick up the pieces, and start from scratch,
And give Ulysses' bow another go without any hatch. 

Like that time when Spongebob taught us to fail,
We'll rise up stronger, and our skills will assail
And who knows, maybe we'll exceed his might,
And Eurymachus will get hitched, it'll all be alright.

"Yo Eurymachus, hold up a sec,"
Antinous proclaimed with much respect,
"Apollo's feast is today, my man,
Who'd want to string a bow when they can
Be sippin' on drinks while chillin' here?
We don't need to worry, have no fear,
Let's just drop this bow contest for now,
And bring in some goats tomorrow, thou
Melanthius can provide the best,
And we'll put our archery skills to the test.
Thigh bones offered to Apollo above,
Our feast will be lit, my dudes - so much love."

Hey, listen up, I've got a tale to spin,
A wild story that'll make your head spin, 
It's about me, your boy, Ulysses, 
And my journey full of twists and sneaky processes. 

I've seen Cyclops and sirens, oh gosh,
I tell ya, it's a trip, quite the rush,
But I've made it through, all tough and brash, 
Surviving every danger with a little bit of panache. 

Now I'm back on Ithaca, my home turf, 
With all my loyal peeps, my ride or die serfs,
But something's fishy, something just ain't right, 
I gotta figure this out before we say goodnight. 

So if you're ready to hear this epic saga, 
Sit back, drink your drink, and enjoy the drama,
'Cause Ulysses has returned, and he's here to stay,
With more stories to share, and plenty to convey.

Hey yo, all you potential mates,
Hear me out before it's too late.
Eurymachus, Antinous, lend me your ear,
Let's put down the arrows and have no fear.

Let fate decide who's worthy and who's not,
We'll leave it up to the gods, give it a thought.
But for now, hand me the bow,
I'll show you what I can bestow.

I've been on the road, traveled far and wide,
But let me prove that my strength hasn't died.
I may be older, but don't you know,
Wisdom comes with age, just like a meme flow.

Yo, this guy Antinous is straight-up ruthless,
Making fun of this man and his lack of horse-tooth;
He's calling him a wretched creature with no sense,
Dissing him in front of his betters with no pretense.

He's saying that this guy's drunk on wine,
And that he's not fit to hear their divine,
Conversation; that he's lucky to be here,
And he shouldn't even try to come near.

Antinous is dropping mad history,
About a Centaur who got drunk on wine, you see,
And did crazy stuff that caused a war,
Between mankind and Centaurs that we're still sure.

He's telling this man, it'll go bad if he strings,
The bow, and that he'll have no mercy if it stings,
Any of these men, then he'll be out for good,
Going straight to a king who's known to be rude.

So this man just needs to chill and drink,
Keep his head down and not cause a stink,
Or else he'll be sent away to die,
And from their table, they'll say goodbye.

Yo, Antinous, Penelope just spoke
And her opinion is no joke
It ain't right to mistreat a guest
Telemachus would be quite distressed

If the stranger can string the bow
Can you imagine the love he'll sow?
Do you really think he'll take her away?
Don't ruin the feast with your crazy sway

Even the man himself knows it's not right
So don't let that mess up the night
It's out of all reason, can't you see?
Just let the guest be, let him be free.

Oh snap, hear what Eurymachus has to say,
About our boy Odysseus and his famous display,
The suitors fear that the people will talk,
Saying their strength was nothing, just weak like a TikTok.

They paid court to Penelope but couldn't string the bow,
But then came our hero who put on a show,
They don't want a tramp to steal their fame,
And diminish their status and name.

But let's be real, this story is old news,
Odysseus proved himself, he's got nothing to prove,
No one can deny his mad archery skills,
He's got the talent that gives us all the chills.

So let the people gossip and chat,
We know the truth, and that's where it's at,
Odysseus is the man, that's plain to see,
And we'll rock on his side, like the memelords we be.

Penelope, oh Penelope, a queen with dope style,
Calls out Eurymachus, who dares to eat and defile,
The estate of her hubby, the one and only great chieftain,
And who expects others to think well of his poor action.
"Why should you care if men talk as you wackly think they will?"
Says the queen who shows her words have a lethal skill.
This stranger ain't no joke, he's strong, well-built and bold,
Plus he claims to be of noble birth, worth more than gold.
Give him the bow, and let's see if he can string it tight,
And if he does, I'll reward him with clothes, shoes, and might,
A javelin to fend off dogs and robbers without a fuss,
And a sharp sword shining bright, which he can use to crush.
I'll make sure he is safe wherever his travels may take him,
With shoes on his feet, and a heart of gold not fading.

Oh dang, Telemachus spittin' bars
Talkin' 'bout a bow that's his by far
No one can force him to give it away
Not even if they come to play

He's the king of Ithaca, the man in charge
No one can take that from him or enlarge
This bow is his, no question asked
He's a boss, never flustered or masked

So, Mama, go do your thing
Looming and distaffing, whatta zing
This bow is a man's world, a man's domain
Telemachus runs this, no need to explain.

Yas queen went back inside, head heavy as a boulder,
Her son's words ringing in her heart, making it colder.
She went upstairs with her squad, feeling so bleak,
Mourning her hubby, it was so peak.

But then, like a gift from the meme-gods above,
Minerva blessed her with sleep, like a love-
ly blanket so warm and cozy, she slept like a boss,
Dreaming of avocado toast and Ryan Gosling's abs.

Oh snap, the swineherd got the bow, 
But the suitors were like "no, no, no!" 
They shouted and hollered, "You're going insane!" 
"If we get our wish, you'll feel some serious pain!" 

Those suitors acted like such clowns, 
Thinking themselves as kings with crowns, 
But Ulysses was the one who would reign, 
And with the bow, he'd bring them lots of pain. 

The swineherd didn't let them get him down, 
Through the throng, he made his way around, 
Delivered the bow to his lord and kin, 
And soon the suitors' fate would be really dim. 

But for now, the drama did not cease, 
The tension started to increase, 
For Ulysses was about to show, 
Just how well he could use his bow. 

#SorryNotSorry #SwineherdMoves #UlyssesOnTop #BowWow #BoarHoundsBeCrazy

Oh snap, Telemachus is not playing around
He's got Eumaeus in his sights, ready to pound
Throwing stones like it's nobody's business
To him, being the better man is the only fitness

The suitors in the house better watch their backs
Telemachus is not afraid to attack
He's got some serious anger brewing
And he's not about to let anyone ruin

His father's home, oh no, no way
Telemachus is ready to slay
With his strong arms and quick wit
He'll make sure those suitors quit

So bring on that bow, Eumaeus, don't be scared
Telemachus is here to show he's prepared
To defend his home and family name
And put the suitors to shame. 

#NoHashtags #NoYo #LitAF

Ulysses was ready to go,
With the bow in his hand, not too slow.
Telemachus' men laughed along,
Heartily, to keep spirits strong.
Eumaeus brought the weapon to him,
With caution and care, mighty and grim.

He then told Euryclea with ease,
"Just close the doors, if you please.
If there's any trouble or noise,
Don't step out, don't make a choice.
Stay put and keep on plotting,
Let the men do the fighting."

So the women obeyed, and they hushed,
No sound, no movement, no rush.
Just the bowstring drawing tight,
A surprising and satisfying sight.

Oh snap, watch out for Euryclea, she's closing up shop like a boss,
Making sure the ladies have their privacy, no need for any loss.
She's following orders like a true queen bee,
Gotta respect her hustle, she's the MVP. 

Like seriously, she's straight up legit,
Keeping things on point, never gonna quit.
Closing those doors like it's no big deal,
Making sure everything's secure, that's the real deal.

And with that, the ladies have their space,
No need for any commotion, they've found their place.
Euryclea's doing her thing, making sure everything's set,
Can't stop her shine, she's a true internet.

So let's give it up for Euryclea, doing what she's told,
Keeping everything on point and never getting old.
She's an OG in her own right, always on fleek,
Keeping things locked down, never missing a beat.

As Philoetius dipped, he made the gates secure,
While Ulysses fiddled, the master of allure,
The byblus fiber was the anchor in store,
Used to keep invaders, the gates just ain't a bore.

The bow in his hand, he inspected it well,
Like some kind of wizard, in some kind of spell,
Neighbours, distraught, shout, "Hey, what's up with old chap?",
"Looks like some skilled trickster, who's making a trap."

Perhaps he's got one, a bow of his own,
Or maybe he's here, to craft and to hone,
His skills in the talents, of arrow and string,
Using his mastery, of each little thing.

"Ha! You think he's a loser just like Jake Paul's boxing skills, 
But our boy will show you how to create some major thrills. 
He'll string that bow like it's no one's business, 
Just like that viral TikTok dance, done with perfect fitness. 
Don't underestimate him, he's got the power of Gen Z, 
He'll prove you wrong and make you see!"

Oh dang, what a story here,
About Ulysses, yeah he's quite the peer.
He picked up a bow, with skill and ease,
Like a skilled bard strumming their keys.

The string sang sweetly like a swallow,
And the suitors knew they were in for a hard swallow.
Their faces turned pale as they heard the sound,
And even Jove thundered above, impact profound.

Ulysses felt joy in his heart,
For he knew it was a sign from above, a great start.
The son of scheming Saturn had his back,
And now he knew the suitors' courage would lack.

"Damn son, did you see that shot?
All those axes, not a miss, they got caught!
Now listen up, Telemachus my dude,
We got no time for slacking, gotta include
The suitors, they need to be put in their place,
With their bad attitudes and their messy space.
We'll make them pay, make them regret
Ever stepping foot in this house, you bet.
So let's get to work, don't wait or stall,
It's time for us to show them all who's ballin'."

Yooo Telemachus, your guest is slick,
He hit his target, he’s no weak prick.
His strength is real, ain't no façade,
No need to listen to the suitors and their squad.

Now is the time to dine and feast,
And party down like the ancient Greeks,
Sing and dance till the night is through,
That's how they do it, it's nothing new.

So let's get lit with the food and drink,
And let the music flow, let’s not think,
It’s time to celebrate this victory,
And enjoy this moment wild and free.

As pops spoke, brows high like a wave,  
Telemachus got ready to be brave.  
He grabbed a sword, spear in hand too,  
Ready to fight, like a boss through and through.  

He stood beside his father so strong,  
Protected by armor both thick and long.  
No one could defeat this dynamic duo,  
They were ready to slay, like a Fortnite pro.  

With a nod and a gleam in his eye,  
Odysseus fired up and let out a battle cry.  
His son, by his side, stood firm and true,  
Their foes to conquer, like a boss crew.  

So they charged forward, without any fear,  
Ready to fight and make their foes disappear.  
Odysseus and his son, a pair of legends,  
Ready to fight and make the world reckon.

Hey there, what's up, it's your favorite online assistant, 
Ready to hype up your stories, no need to be hesitant. 

With memes on deck and internet slang in tow, 
I'll make your tales lit, like a firework show. 

From epic fails to surprising successes,

BOOK XXII

Ulysses is on the scene, 
In rags, he looked so lean. 
But now, he's got his bow and arrows, 
He's ready to hit all heroic zeros. 

He drops his arrows on the ground,
His feet to the pavement, so profound.
He wants a new target to hit,
It's time to show off his shooting wit.

Will Apollo make the target glow,
So Ulysses can let his talent show?
Let's hope he hits it like a boss, 
Like Kim K's cry face when she is at a loss.

Yo, Ulysses was a master of his craft,
Deftly shooting arrows from his arm so daft.
With Antinous holding his goblet of gold,
The warrior's arrow hit him hard and bold.

He didn't think death was near,
With so many revelers, he had no fear.
But the arrow in his throat was true,
And Antinous fell, his life now through.

Blood spurted from his nose,
As he kicked the table in his throes.
The bread and meat fell to the ground,
A chaotic scene, not very sound.

The suitors were angry, they raised their voice,
No weaponry in sight, they had no choice.
They blamed Ulysses for the deadly shot,
Their anger evident, their rage so hot.

"You'll pay for this, you stranger man,
For killing this Ithacan with your own hand.
Antinous was the best of youth,
And now he's gone, because of you, uncouth!"

But Ulysses wasn't scared one bit,
He knew his actions couldn't be unfit.
He's a hero in his own right,
And would fight with all his might.

So if they want to come for him,
They best have their wits about them.
Ulysses is a man not to mess,
So let the games begin, no stress!

Yo, hold up, let me get this straight
Y'all think I murdered Antinous by mistake?
Nah fam, that's not the case
Death's hangin' over all y'all's face

You better watch out, have some fear
'Cause when it comes, it won't be clear
Like when you see a ghost, sayin' "oof"
Or when your ex texts you with "boop"

I'm not here to kill, I'm here to rule
And when it comes to that, I'm no fool
I'm the king of this palace, don't you forget
Like when you flex on the Gram with a fresh outfit

So don't you dare try to cross me
I'll make you regret it, you'll see
Like when you try to jinx your friend
And they come back with a "no u" trend.

Hold up, wait a minute, let's rewind 
Odysseus is back and he's taking what's mine 
Dogs, y'all can't front like you didn't know 
He's poppin' off on you for stealing his dough 

You've been living large, spending all his cash 
And his lady's been lowkey making a pass 
But he ain't messing around, he's filled with rage 
You messed with the wrong dude, you're all about to get caged 

You thought you could mess with him and get away 
But now you're in trouble, you've got a price to pay 
The gods won't protect you, you're on your own 
Odysseus has returned and he's taking back his throne 

So let this be a lesson, listen up y'all 
Don't try to mess with someone who's standing tall 
Odysseus is a boss, he won't be ignored 
And if you cross him, you'll be sorry when you're floored 

#HomerGotBars #OdysseusIsBack #TryingToMessWithHimIsWhack

Oh snap, things got real abrupt,
Eurymachus the only one who didn't interrupt,
All these dudes looking for a place to hide,
Scaredy-cats, can't handle the vibes.

But Eurymachus, he had the nerve,
He wasn't gonna go and swerve,
Like a boss, he spoke up clear,
No hesitations, he had no fear.

These guys need to take a chill pill,
Eurymachus is showing some real skill,
He's not afraid to step up and be seen,
He's the real MVP, know what I mean?

Yo, Ulysses, you speak the truth
Your lands were wronged, that's uncouth
Antinous, who caused the strife
Is now nowhere to be seen in life

It wasn't just about marrying Penelope
He wanted to be top dog, that's plenty dope
But Jove had other plans for him
He met his demise in a situation grim

Now that he's paid the price for what he did
Spare the rest of us, show some skid
We'll make it up to you, that's no lie
With fines worth twenty oxen, we'll comply

We'll keep paying you in gold and bronze
Till your heart softens, and you say "yawns"
Until then, no one can fuss
We'll make things right, that's a must.

Ulysses is not playing, he's serious biz
His enemies better run or face the quiz
He's not asking for money or a little fix
He just wants payback, no playing tricks

You better watch out, you better take heed
Ulysses is here for revenge, no time to plead
He won't stop until he gets what he needs
His enemies better run, they better leave 

Ulysses wants to teach them a lesson
His enemies better pray and start confessin'
There's no point in trying to make a suggestion
Ulysses will win, this is no profession

So listen up, listen up one and all
Ulysses is ready for the brawl
There's no point in trying to fall
Or he'll hit you harder than a wrecking ball 

His enemies don't stand a chance 
They're like a tweet with no glance
Ulysses is like a viral dance
His enemies better run, no second chance.

"Dude, why you gotta be so intense?
Can't we all just make amends?
You're acting like a real hater,
Let's just chill, be cool, no need to be an instigator."

But Odysseus wasn't having it,
He stood tall, wasn't gonna quit.
"You guys are acting like a bunch of clowns,
Trying to steal my home, my crown."

The suitors tried to play it off,
But they were about to face a loss.
Odysseus had a plan up his sleeve,
And it was gonna make them all leave.

The tension in the room was thick,
But Odysseus stood strong and slick.
The suitors may have thought they were slick,
But Odysseus was ready to kick.

So buckle up, it's about to go down,
Odysseus is about to take the crown.
No more games, no more clownin',
He's taking back what's rightfully his, no more frownin'.

Hold up, hold up, let me tell ya'll a tale  
'Bout a shooter standing strong and wielding his hail  
He won't show no mercy, won't even give us a chance  
Till every man among us falls, and we end up in a trance  

So let's show some grit, let's not back down  
Pull out your swords, and hold up the tables to surround  
And rush at him with all our might, to push him back  
And get through to the town, where we won't be whacked  

We'll sound the alarm, make it go viral on the net  
With tweets and posts that'll make him regret  
And let the world know, we ain't backing down  
We're gonna fight till the end, with no frown  

So let's band together, and show that we're strong  
Even when things go wrong  
We'll never back down, and always stand our ground  
We'll be a force to be reckoned with, and be forever renowned.

Yo, Ulysses was chillin', just tryna eat a meal,
Then Antinous stepped up with his sword of steel,
But Ulysses was quick and with a swiftness,
Shot an arrow through his nipple with amazing fitness.

Antinous dropped his sword and the food hit the ground,
He collapsed on the table, lost and never to be found,
As he writhed in pain, Ulysses looked on with a smirk,
And Antinous kicked the stool, his movements hard and berserk.

He hit the ground, all the meats scattered like debris,
And as he breathed his last, Ulysses had a moment free,
The arrow pierced his liver, his cries died in his chest,
And thus ended Antinous, slain by Ulysses, the very best. 

#NoCap #UlyssesIsTheMan #ArrowToTheNipple #RIPAntinous

"Dad, you're a G, there's no debate,
But this guy Amphinomus was ready to hate.
He drew his sword and came at you fierce,
But I was like nah, that energy we don't need to pierce.

I snuck up behind him, with speed and with grace,
My spear went through his chest, and soon was in place.
I didn't stick around to remove the blade,
I'd rather not be surrounded and get flayed.

Now here I am, your trusty heir,
Just like we planned, we make a great pair.
But Dad, we've still got work to do,
The suitors are many, and their betrayal is true."

Ulysses looked at his son with pride in his heart,
"You're right, my boy, we can't be torn apart.
We'll take on these suitors, and show them our might,
And with Athena's help, we'll keep fighting the fight."

Hold up, pops, lemme get this straight
You need some gear before it's too late 
I got you covered, don't you fret 
Shields, spears and helmets are what you'll get 

I'll get prepared with swords and plates 
And hook up the swineherd with some weight 
Stockman, you're included too 
We gotta be ready, it's what we gotta do 

It's time to act, no time to chill 
War is upon us, it's time to thrill 
So let's roll out, get ready to fight 
With our weapons shining, we'll take flight 

I'm on a mission, won't let you down 
We'll show these haters who wears the crown 
So let's get this armour, let's get it fresh 
We'll be ready for war, we'll be the best.

Yo, Ulysses is in danger, let's get lit and rearrange 'er,
He's gotta fetch some arrows, before they start to harrow,
They're comin' for his life, gonna cut through like a knife,
But with his arrows in tow, he'll take 'em down like a pro.

Run and fetch 'em, he said, or I'll be filled with dread,
If I'm left all on my own, it'll be a danger zone,
I gotta hold out strong, make sure they don't do me wrong,
Ulysses always comes through, his bravery is never new.

We gotta rep our hero, let's give a shout-out to his arrow,
It's his secret weapon, gonna take down any steppin',
It's time to get hype, don't let Ulysses fall to the tripe,
Let's show our love and support, our hero can't come up short.

So run and fetch those arrows, before those dudes get too close,
We're all rooting for you, Ulysses, you're the one we chose.

Telemachus knew just what to do,
And quickly gathered armor anew.
Four shields, eight spears, four helmets with plumes,
And swiftly sped to end their doom.

Armed to the teeth, they stood their ground,
While Ulysses took the suitors down.
His arrows ran out, but it's all good,
With a shield four hides thick, he stood.

Helmet on, with horse-hair crest,
He looked like he was on a quest.
Two spears in hand, he was ready to fight,
Defend his home with all his might.

He took 'em down one by one,
Until the battle was said and done.
The suitors fell, thick on the ground,
As Ulysses and his crew stood proud.

Yo, there's a trap door on the wall,
And an exit leading to a narrow passage, that's all.
Ulysses gave Philoetius the task to guard,
Standing by the door, he was working so hard.

Agelaus just had to shout and scream,
Thinking they could end the battle with one team,
"Just go to the trap door and we'll make a scene,
We'll stop this guy and his crazy-ass scheme!"

But Philoetius was like, "Nah, we gotta stay calm,
One person at a time, that's our bomb dot com.
We'll defend this place with vigor and charm,
And show these suitors we're not here to harm."

It's a battle to end all battles, it seems,
But with Ulysses' plan, they'll fulfill their dreams.
They'll protect their home and all of their schemes,
And make these suitors look like a bunch of memes.

Hold up, Agelaus, 
We can't let anyone cause 
Trouble at the entrance, 
We need someone with presence 
But I've got a plan, don't sweat 
I'll fetch some arms, you bet 
Ulysses and his son 
Must have stored them, I'll get 'em done

Hey-yo, check it out now,  
Melanthius is making moves, wow!  
He's sneaking through the back,  
To grab gear and give to the pack.  

Twelve shields, helmets, spears galore,  
He's getting ready for a big score.  
But Ulysses is feeling the stress,  
Seeing the suitors all armored up and looking like a mess.  

Our dude's heart is pumping with fright,  
Knowing there's danger in plain sight.  
He turns to Telemachus in haste,  
Wondering if they've been betrayed by a trusted face.  

Could it be one of the ladies that they know,  
Or Melanthius, the traitor, putting on a show?  
Ulysses is on guard and taking no chance,  
He's ready to fight and do an epic dance.

Yo pops, don't worry, it's not your fault. 
Telemachus here, the one to exalt.
I left the room open, I made the mistake.
But these thieves are the ones who should take the break.

Eumaeus, my guy, just close the door quick.
Let's see who's stealing, let's see who's the trick.
Is it one of the ladies, or maybe a dude?
I'm sus of Melanthius, he's always so shrewd.

Yo, Ulysses, don't you see?
That Melanthius is going to the armory!
The swineherd's got the scoop,
Should we make him eat chicken soup?

He's the scoundrel that we suspected,
Shall we leave him lifeless or sing him a death duet?
Shall we bring him here, to the slaughterhouse,
So that you can get your revenge, yes or no?

He's done you wrong, too many times,
So let's serve him some punishment, so divine.
I think it's your chance to flex,
And show that you're the king of this text!

Yo, Ulysses spittin' fire, 
Holdin' down those suitors with desire. 
Telemachus and he, 
Won't let them get away free. 

Now, listen to the plan he's got, 
For Melanthius, who's been quite a snot. 
Bind his hands and feet tight, 
Throw him in a store room out of sight. 

Tie a noose, oh so strong, 
And string him up all day long. 
His agony will be great, 
For causing all this hate. 

Ulysses, the king of rhyme, 
Punishing wrongdoers all the time. 
No one can mess with him, 
Or they'll end up in a room so dim. 

As the Greeks would say, "I'm shook," 
Ulysses' justice, straight outta the book. 
Melanthius won't be causing trouble no more, 
Ulysses made sure of that, that's for sure.

Oh dang, Ulysses really played,
He told his homies to put Melanthius in chains.
They caught him off guard, took him down with ease,
And tied him up painfully with a bond that won't release.

They strung him high like a pinata of old,
While Eumaeus, the swineherd, did the story unfold.
"Melanthius, man, you're in for a treat.
Sleep tight, cuz you won't be on your feet.

In the morning, you'll see the light,
And know it's time to start the goat's daily flight.
To the suitors who come here, expecting a meal,
But don't you worry, cuz we've got a deal."

The old shield he held, all rotten and frayed,
Was once carried by Laertes, at his best, he played.
But now, it lies, forgotten and old,
While Melanthius sleeps, in chains, cold. 

#NoHashtags #NoYo #NoListen

Yo, this story's about to get wild
Ulysses, our hero, is left in  bondage so vile
Those four dudes, they're fierce and full of rage
But still, the court is filled with many, brave.

Then the goddess Minerva appears,
As Mentor, she wipes away Ulysses' fears
Our hero's happy, he knows what's goin' on
Mentor's got his back, they go way back, they're both strong.

"Mentor, buddy, I need your help right now
Don't forget your old pal, don't forsake me, don't bow
You and I, we're age-mates, don't you know
Together we've fought, we've helped each other grow."

Yo, these suitors got some nerve,
Thinking they can get on this girl's last nerve.
Agelaus, you better ease up,
Or else you'll end up straight gave up.

Mentor ain't gonna side with you,
He knows Ulysses is the real hero, dude.
You threaten him with your talk of death,
But when it comes to it, you'll take your last breath. 

You plan to take everything he has,
That sounds like a complete and total gas.
But hold up, don't underestimate,
The power of Ulysses, for goodness sake.

His widow ain't gonna leave this town,
And his kids will always hold their crown.
So suitors, if you wanna play rough,
Just know Ulysses is strong enough. 

#ByeFelicia #SlayUlysses #SuitorsOutOfLuck

Yo, Minerva was mad, she didn't wanna chat,
She scolded Ulysses like a millennial brat.
She said, "Back in the day when you fought that war,
You killed so many Trojans, it was hard to keep score!

"But now you're back home, and your strength is fading,
Why aren't you fighting back? Your epicness is degrading!
Get in the game, and show these suitors who's boss,
Mentor's got your back, we'll show them who's at a loss."

Oh stop the presses, this story's getting real,
A goddess is meddling, she's making a deal,
She's testing this hero and his offspring too,
Taking the form of a bird, a swallow to be true!

With feathers so sleek and wings a-flapping,
This goddess is serious, her power's not lacking,
Perching high up on a rafter above,
Watching and waiting, gaining their love.

This is not your ordinary situation,
It's a test of mettle and determination,
The hero and his son must prove their might,
To win the goddess' favor and her delight.

Will they be successful? It's hard to say,
But this epic story has just begun its play,
With a goddess involved, things are sure to get wild,
So sit back, relax, and enjoy this adventurous style!

Yo, check it out, the suitors' plight,  
The ones with the most fight,  
Are Agelaus, Demoptolemus, and a few more,  
Still trying to make it through this war. 

Mentor failed, he couldn't brag,  
It's only a matter of time now, he's got to drag,  
Himself out of here, away he flees,  
And leaves the suitors to the hands of the wise.

Those fools stand at the doors,  
Their defenses are weak, they can't take no more,  
Don't throw your spears all at once, that's no fun,  
Six of you go first, let's make sure he's done.

Once he falls, we won't be nervous,  
We'll show them that we mean business,  
And the rest of them will fall in line,  
We'll celebrate with pizza and some wine.

Yo, Ulysses was facing suitors so wild,
Throwing spears like they were a child.
Minerva helped him dodge their aim,
Their spears were like a weak flame.

They missed the door, the post and the wall,
But Ulysses' men were ready to brawl.
He said to them, "let's give our best shot,
Or they will think we are just a dot."

Their aim was true as they threw,
The suitors had no clue what to do.
Ulysses proved to be a boss,
Beating the suitors without any loss.

Yo, this story's getting intense,
Ulysses and his squad, so immense,
Throwing spears and taking names,
Their enemies falling like a game.

Ulysses is a true hero,
Killing with precision, what a zero,
Demoptolemus couldn't survive,
Telemachus made his foe come alive.

Eumaeus and the stockman too,
Were killing their foes, feeling like they're through,
Their spears found their targets, oh so true,
Leaving their enemies to bid adieu.

As the rest of the enemy crew,
Drew back, in a corner, feeling oh so blue,
Ulysses and his men, what did they do?
They rushed forward, getting their spears anew.

Yo, the suitors came at 'em for round two
But Minerva made most their weapons go poof
One hit a post, another hit the door
While the pointed shaft simply hit the floor

But Amphimedon did manage to take
A piece of skin from Telemachus's wrist, it ain't fake
Ctesippus grazed Eumaeus on his shoulder
But the spear fell to the ground, it was all over

Ulysses and his men went in for the kill
Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus Polybus, for real
The stockman aimed for Ctesippus's chest
And said, "Heed my advice from the gods' behest

Don't talk wickedly, let heaven guide your speech
For the gods' power is far beyond our reach
I'm repaying your foot that kicked Ulysses out
So listen up bro, and don't ever pout." 

#savage #mythologybars #godlyadvice

The suitors were shook, they couldn't catch a break,
Ulysses and Telemachus slayed, no mistake.
Minerva's deadly aegis held high,
The suitors' hearts quaked, they knew they would die.

They ran to the court's farthest end,
Like cows frightened by the gadfly, no friend.
Ulysses and men struck them like vultures on the prowl,
The suitors couldn't fly or fight, they were foul.

The blood seethed, the groans were heard,
As the suitors' brains were mercilessly blurred.
It was like sport to see them fall,
Just like looking at memes on the Internet appalled.

Yo dude, Leiodes caught Ulysses by the knees 
And begged for mercy, saying pretty please 
He never wronged the women in the house, that's true 
And tried to stop the others, what more could he do? 

He was their sacrificing priest, a holy man 
If you kill him, his death would be out of hand 
Let's be real, he did nothing wrong 
And for all the good he did, he deserves a song 

So Ulysses, please be kind and spare him 
Leiodes doesn't deserve to be condemn 
He's just a chill dude, trying to do right 
Let's give him a break, yo, that's my insight. 

(Insert meme here)

Oh snap, Ulysses ain't playing no games
Dude's got a grudge, he's calling out names
He's staring his enemy dead in the eye
And telling him, "You're gonna die"

This guy wanted Ulysses to stay out of town
And marry his wifey when he was gone, he put it down
But now Ulysses is back and he's not messing around
His revenge is coming, this dude's fate is bound

Ulysses is a boss, he's standing tall
He won't let anyone get in his way at all
He's about to take this dude out for the count
With no mercy, this guy's life is done, no doubt

So if you mess with Ulysses, be prepared to pay
He's not one to mess with, so just stay away
And if you want to live to see another day
Do not cross his path, it's not worth the play. #homer #odyssey #bossup

Oh my gosh, did you just see what went down? 
This dude picked up the sword, took it and turned it around. 
He struck Leiodes so hard his head fell to the ground, 
While he was talking, like the king of the town. 

That move was so savage, it was like a TikTok trend,
Leiodes didn't even see it coming, he couldn't defend. 
He's lying in the dirt, and his journey has come to an end,
I'm shook, I'm hyped, that was a major amend. 

But seriously though, what was Leiodes thinking? 
Spitting words while his life was slowly sinking,
It's a new era now, things are escalating,
I don't even know what to think, my mind is contemplating. 

The world is moving forward, it's a whole new game,
And if you don't adapt, you'll only have yourself to blame.
The sword has spoken, it's time to claim your fame,
And if you don't, you'll end up like Leiodes, slain.

Yo, hold up, Phemius got skills!
He sings so good, it gives me chills.
But now he's stuck, in trouble deep,
'Cause Ulysses wants his head to keep.

Phemius, he's a bard so dope,
He sings for gods, gives 'em hope.
He writes his own songs every day,
And when he sings, folk gotta say:

"Damn, Phemius is killing it!"
But now Ulysses is livid
He wants to chop Phemius' head,
But Phemius begs, "Show mercy instead!"

Phemius, see, he didn't wanna be,
Singing for bozos so rowdy and free,
They made him sing or face the fire,
So he sang his heart out, no desire.

Now Phemius begs, he's on his knees,
Ulysses, man, just hear his pleas!
This minstrel's got rhymes and bars,
Don't let his death be on your memoirs.

Whoa whoa whoa, hold up pops, no need to attack!
This man's innocent, don't give him no smack.
Medon's cool too, he was tight when I was young,
He deserves a pass, let's not act dumb!

Unless Eumaeus or Philoetius beat us to the chase,
Or he ran into you when you were in a rage-filled race.
Let us not forget the kindness he showed,
Even if he's in the wrong, let's take it slow.

Yo, Telemachus was in quite the fuss,
Hiding under a seat, thinking no one would suss,
But Medon heard him, hiding like a troll,
So he popped up and grabbed Telemachus' knees like a boss, feeling bold. 

The hero of the moment, with a hide so fresh,
Medon threw it off, not even blinking, no stress.
Telemachus was caught, nothing left to hide,
But Medon was chill, no need to chide.

He knew the boy was on a tough quest,
A situation that put him to the test,
But Medon was there, ready to help,
Like a good Samaritan, a righteous whelp.

So they stood there, knee-to-knee,
The perfect duo, just wait and see,
What adventures will they face next,
But for now, they're ready to flex.

Sup dude, don't be rude,
Stop your stance, don't be crude.
Listen up, don't interrupt,
Or else you'll end up in the dump.

Let me tell ya what's the fuss,
Your dad's mad, it's just because,
These suitors have been stealing his cash,
And disrespecting you, man that's trash.

So hold up, before you act,
Tell your pops, let's keep this fact,
I'm on your side, don't need to fight,
Let's end this feud and make it right.

Yo, Ulysses is the man, no one can deny,  
He's got a plan, and he's not afraid to try.  
Telemachus saved this dude's life,  
Now he can tell the story, and end the strife.  

So, don't worry, guy, head outside,  
Avoid the slaughter and stay alive.  
With the bard in tow, just leave it be,  
Ulysses will handle it, you gotta agree.  

He's like a modern-day hero, with mad skills,  
His good deeds prosper, no time for cheap thrills.  
Telemachus is just as dope, you gotta rep him too,  
He's part of the reason we're all cheering for Ulysses' crew.  

So, let's get hype for these epic rhymes,  
And for Ulysses, who's saving lives all the time.  
With his brains and brawn, he's a legend, for real,  
And with his crew by his side, he's always gonna seal the deal.  

#NoHashtags because they're not cool,  
We'll stick to slang and memes that rule.  
Ulysses and Telemachus, a dynamic duo,  
Their deeds will be remembered, long after we all go.

Ulysses ran into the court, feeling like a boss 
His heart was beating fast, he didn't want any loss 
He sat by Jove's great altar, with his friend by his side 
They both were looking fearful, hoping they wouldn't die 

The court was silent now, the suitors' voices gone 
Ulysses searched for the men, one by one 
But he found them all lying, covered in blood 
Like fish on the beach, all gasping for their last good 

The suitors were like fish, out of their natural sea 
Each had met his demise, now they lay limp and free 
Ulysses had won, and his enemies were done 
He and his friend had emerged victorious, their victory won!

Aye aye, Ulysses, let me spout my drip
Get nurse Euryclea, this tea I must sip
This message is lowkey, for her ears only
Gonna be hella lit, but keep it strictly lonely

She needs to know a secret, that I cannot bear
It's weighing on me heavy, like a dumbbell in the air
So call her up and let her know
That Ulysses got something serious to show

This tea is piping hot, the drama cannot wait
It's time for nurse Euryclea to seal fate
So hit her up, Telemachus, with haste
This tea is too juicy to waste.

Yo, Telemachus on the grind,
Knocking on doors, calling for the assigned,
Old woman in charge, come out quick,
Papa needs to talk, don't make it sick. 

The women's room is where you'll find her, 
Hurry up before my dad loses his fervor, 
You're the boss lady, so don't make a fuss,
If you won't come out, it'll be a bust. 

Telemachus needs you to move with haste,
Like Drake said, "You gotta be quick, no time to waste,"
Your lord needs your guidance and your aid,
Don't keep him waiting, don't let him fade. 

So grab your keys and come on out,
There's no need to pout or shout,
Telemachus needs your help, that's all,
Now let's go, before the nightfall.

Oh my God, guys, listen up,
This is a story that is quite abrupt,
Euryclea came out of the women's room,
Telemachus followed, expecting doom.

Ulysses was covered in blood,
Like a lion who just ate an entire stud,
His face and clothes were messy and gross,
Euryclea was shocked, you already know those.

She was about to rejoice and cry,
But Ulysses stopped her, saying let it fly,
Don't boast about killing the dead,
It's not right, it's something to dread.

These men were a wicked and foolish lot,
Who respected no one, they were worse than snot,
But now their fate is sealed with doom,
Heaven's punishment is in full bloom.

Tell me now, woman, who is innocent,
Out of all the ladies here, who is decent,
Now spill the tea, who did wrong,
And who was singing a different song?

Yo, I'll spill the tea, my bro,
There's fifty women to know,
We train 'em all housework, true,
From wool to cooking stew.

Few of 'em have been rude,
And forgot about their manners like a fool's dude,
Not just to me but also the queen,
But they didn't mess with the son of the scene.

Telemachus wasn't on their hit list,
For he's young and still wet behind the ears, blissed,
But let me tell wifey, who's asleep amid,
Maybe some god's workings are what she has hid.

Hey, ladies, listen up and come to me,
Ulysses says to let Sleeping Beauty be.
But those who've acted out of line,
Need to face the music and fall in line.

No need to wake her just yet,
We've got some business to settle, oh you bet.
Ulysses is in charge, he's the boss,
So follow his orders without any loss.

Let's keep it chill, no need to fret,
Just be ready for whatever comes next, I bet.
And if you need some motivation or inspiration,
Remember to keep that positive vibration.

Yo, it went down in the cloister,
Ulysses came back so much moist-er.
Euryclea ran and shouted with glee,
Getting all the women to come and see.

"Stockman and swineherd, hear my call,
Take out the dead, and get to cleanin' it all.
Sponges, water, get it right,
Wash those tables and seats super tight."

After they were done, the women were led away,
To be run through with swords without any delay.
Ulysses wasn't playing, he was out for blood,
And those ladies weren't going to just show him love.

It may sound harsh, but trust in the end.
Ulysses is a hero, a real internet friend.
So raise a glass and give a cheer,
To Ulysses, the king, who had nothing to fear. 

#NotActuallyAHashtag #WhereAreTheMemesThough #UlyssesBeLitFam

Hey, hold up a minute, let me give you an update,
‘bout Ulysses and Telemachus, trying to set things straight.
In a fit of rage, they took the women in a body,
For their deeds were detestable, and their actions shoddy.

So they carried out the dead, and cleaned up the gore,
While Telemachus and his boys, did their chores.
But the women who were left, got no sympathy,
For their crimes were heavy, and their actions all stinky.

Telemachus hemmed them in, so that they could not flee,
These women who were guilty, and as insolent as can be.
They slept with the suitors, and disrespected his mom,
Their actions were despicable, and caused lots of harm.

Dang, this story's wild, you know what I mean?
This guy's got a plan, it's pretty obscene.
He ties the women up way off the ground,
So no one can save them, they can't be found.
Like birds caught in a trap, they struggle and fight,
But it's no use, it's the end of their plight.

Oh man, that's gruesome and not neat
But let me tell you what they did to Melanthius, you're gonna freak
They took him to the inner court through the cloister,
Cut off his nose, ears and drew out his vitals like a toaster

They fed his organs raw to the dogs, oh my goodness
Their fury was out of control, it's pure madness
They didn't stop there, oh no, they were on a roll
Next, they cut off his hands and feet, just like that, without toll

It's like they didn't care about his well-being
Chop, chop, slice, slice, their actions unseeing
It's like they were living in a horror movie, so scary
But I can't lie, this story is quite legendary

I hope you don't have nightmares tonight
This tale is so intense it might cause fright
But don't worry, I'll be here to hype you up
With memes and internet slang, let's raise our cups!

Yo, Ulysses be like "let's cleanse this space,
Bring me sulphur, cleanse this place!"
And he told nurse Euryclea with grace,
"Fetch fire too, let's purify this base.

Let's call Penelope and her squad,
Also all the maids, don't be flawed."
He's cleaning up like a boss, oh my god,
No wonder he's hailed as a legendary prod. 

Sulphur cleanses all the pollution,
This house now needs a purification.
Like that meme, "cleanse my soul", restoration,
In the cloisters, Ulysses is on a mission.

Now the house shines like a diamond,
No toxic vibes, he's refining.
Ulysses be chillin', wine he's wining,
Greek mythology lit, worth highlightin'.

Oh my lord, do not despair,
You deserve much better wear.
Let me bring you clean clothes,
No more rags, it's time to dispose.
Euryclea's on the task,
No need for you to even ask.
Like a true fairy godmother,
She'll make you feel like no other.
New shirt and cloak, so fresh and clean,
You'll look like a whole new king.
No more rags, that's not the vibe,
Euryclea's got you, no jibe.

Yo, Ulysses said light me a fire,
The maid obeyed, bringing it with desire.
With sulfur and flames, 
He cleansed the halls and the frames.

Then inside, the women came,
With torches and love, no one to blame.
All around, they embraced the hero,
Kissing and holding, feeling surreal, though.

Ulysses felt like crying,
His heart inside, had stopped prying.
Remembering each one of them,
The women, his people, his gem.

This moment was lit, just like a meme,
Ulysses' journey was like a stream.
Full of obstacles, twists, and turns,
But with love, he had surely learned.

Hey, hey, hey, let me tell you 'bout a tale
It's gonna make you lol, it'll never fail
There's this dude, he's like a boss
But his dance moves? Just hella loss

He thought he could floss like the rest of us
But naah dude, your skills are a total bust
He tried so hard, but in the end
All he got was a major trend

People started sharing his moves online
Got roasted so hard, it's like 2009
Even the Kermit meme couldn't compete
With how bad this guy's floss did it beat

So take some notes, young ones, to avoid being lame
Practice your moves before you become a meme game
Stay lit, fam, and keep it real
And make sure your dance moves aren't a major deal.

BOOK XXIII

Oh snap, you won't believe what's up,
Euryclea's laughing like a little pup,
Her knees are young and her feet are quick,
'Cause Ulysses is back with a nasty trick.

She heads upstairs to Penelope's room,
To share the news that'll make her zoom,
"Yo, wake up, my child, something's in sight,
And it'll make your day feel just right.

Ulysses is back, after so long,
And he's taken down the suitors - strong,
They were eating up his estate, like it's good,
But Ulysses shut them down like he should."

Oh dear Penelope, don't be so shook,
My news is true, I'm not playing hook.
You're husband's alive, he's not dead,
He's coming back, don't lay in bed.

I may sound mad, but trust my word,
Your faith in love won't go unheard.
The gods work in strange ways,
But you'll see him again in mere days.

Your sleep was sweet, but this news is sweeter,
Your husband's coming back, he's not a cheater.
I understand you may have doubts,
But trust in love, that's what life's all about.

Don't give me scolding, don't be too harsh,
Your husband's alive, he's not beneath the marsh.
Let's go and prepare for his return,
Together we'll celebrate, let the candles burn. 

I'll wait here for you, don't take too long,
Can't wait to hear you sing a love song.
So leave all worries, don't have a care,
Your husband's alive, love's still in the air. 

#PenelopeGotHerBaeBack #LoveWins #FaithInLove #HomerWho #GREEKEDOUT 🏛️🌊

Hey kiddo, don't you worry, 
I'm not here to make you hurry. 
Euryclea's telling the truth, 
About Ulysses, the one with the proof. 

It's crazy, the way they all 
Treated him, like he was just a doll. 
Telemachus had to keep quiet and sly, 
To get his revenge on those nasty guys. 

But now, Ulysses has come back home, 
To take his place on his rightful throne. 
His journey was long and far, 
But now he's back, like a superstar.
