Yo, he found her at home, all on her own,
She was a weavin' her loom, her talent shown.
The fire was lit, cedar and sandalwood scent,
Smellin' so good, like a candle that's heaven sent.

She sang while she worked, her voice so sweet,
Birds flew around, can't accept defeat.
Owls, hawks, and sea-crows, making their sounds,
All in one place, their home so profound.

The cave was covered, in trees so lush,
A vine with grapes, all ripe to crush.
Four running rills of water, a sight to see,
Doused the violets and herbage, you can be.

Mercury stopped, looked at the view,
Couldn't help but to adore, feels so new,
The god couldn't help but go inside,
To enjoy the beauty, can't hide.

Yo, Calypso knew him from the start
For the gods, it's not hard to play their part
Ulysses, though, wasn't around
He was at the beach with tears he found
Mercury got a seat from the goddess
She was happy since his visit wasn't a mess
"Why have you come?" she asked with love
"I'll do it now, just name your goal above"
"Come in, refreshments I'll provide
Let's sit and chat, don't let it slide."

Oh dang, this ambrosia is sick, it's got me feeling so quick! 
This red nectar is lit, can't lie, it's a perfect fit. 
But hold up, wait a minute, let me catch my breath, 
Because this moment is way too lit to forget. 

Mercury took a sip and felt alive,
The taste was so good, he had to high-five! 
This ambrosia is the key to immortality,
It's so bomb, it's practically a reality.

And don't even get me started on the red nectar,
It gives me energy like an electric vector. 
My taste buds are jumping with joy,
I feel like a kid with a brand new toy.

Mercury shook his head in amazement,
This food was too good to not make a statement. 
He thanked her for the meal with a grin,
And then flew off into the beyond, feeling like a champ, win-win!

Oh my goodness, gods and goddesses galore,  
This guy's telling a tale, let me give you some more.  
Just listen up, he was sent by Jove,  
And we all know crossing him, you better be above.  

He didn't wanna come, it was an order in fact,  
But his divine duties, he couldn't retract.  
This man he speaks of, he's so ill-starred,  
Fought in a war, came home, and things went hard.  

He and his crew, they made a grave mistake,  
Against Minerva, they were in a losing shake.  
She made wind and waves, to cause disaster,  
Leaving just one man to survive the aftermath faster.  

So now he's here, far from his own kin,  
But Jove's got a decree which he wants to begin.  
Let this poor soul go back to his own place,  
And see his friends, his land, his face.

"Y'all gods need to chill, seriously," Calypso raged, her anger set afire,
"Always jealous when us goddesses take a mortal as our desire.
When Dawn got busy with Orion, you flipped out, acting like drama queens,
And when Ceres hooked up with Iasion, you killed him with your godly means.
And now you're mad at me just 'cause I found a guy I liked,
I rescued him from the shipwreck, saw he survived.
I loved him and wanted him to be immortal, it's true,
But I can't go against Jove, I've got better things to do.
If he insists on leaving, I won't stop him, though it breaks my heart,
But I'll give him advice, try and make sure he won't fall apart.
I can't send him myself, so he'll have to find his own way,
But I gotcha, boo, I'mma help him out, so he can make it through the day."

Oh snap, Mercury's got jokes  
Sending folks away like it's no big hoax  
Jove's not playing, he'll punish you with wrath  
Better listen up, he's the big boss in this path  

Mercury's chill, but he means business for sure  
Don't wanna mess up and make Jove impure  
Sending someone away might be hard to do  
But disobeying Jove is so not cool  

So take heed, my peeps, and do what's right  
Or you might end up facing Jove's powerful might  
Mercury's warning is no laughing matter  
Don't wanna end up like a Twitter hashtag, #scatter

Yo Ulysses, I heard the news,
Jove's message to you ain't no ruse.
You've been here with me for so long,
But I know that you wanna go home.

You're crying tears and feeling so down,
It's like you're always wearing a frown.
You're sick of this island and me,
And you want to be where you're meant to be.

You spend your days by the sea,
Wishing that you could feel free.
But let me be clear, my dear,
You won't find freedom here.

I know you miss your wife and child,
It's time to go back and be reconciled.
It's time to leave this paradise,
And return to your own slice of life.

So pack your bags, it's time to leave,
The world outside is waiting for thee.
Don't be sad, don't you cry,
Just say your goodbyes and fly high.

Now let's go, don't be shy,
Your adventure is waiting, don't ask why.
And remember, when you're feeling blue,
You'll always have Calypso, that's true.

"Ay homie, no more frownin' in this townin' 
I'm finna help you bounce, no more lookin' downin'
We'll send you off, but not in a coffin
Build a lit raft, with an upper deck poppin'

I'll pack it with bread, water and wine
So you don't starve on your way to cloud nine
Some clothes too, so you can look fresh
Hope the gods bless your journey, that'd be the best

They know what's up, they got the power
To send a fair wind and make it a shower
Of blessings on blessings, on your voyage to home
A trip so fly, it'll make you never wanna roam."

Ulysses, my dude, chill out for a sec,
Your reaction to the goddess, disrespect.
She's offering you a way back to Ithaca town,
Don't be so quick to bring her down.

But I get it, taking a raft is not ideal,
Especially if you want to safely seal the deal.
But hear me out, bro, she knows what's best,
And wants to help you pass this daunting test.

I know it sounds risky, I won't even lie,
But trust in the goddess, don't ask why.
She's on your side, she's got your back,
Swear that she won't hurt you, that's the tack.

So pack your bags, and let's set sail,
We'll make it there, and you'll prevail.
Don't worry about the journey, it'll be fine,
Just trust the goddess, and we'll be in Ithaca in no time.

(YOLO, amirite?)

Yo, Calypso spittin' facts,
Caressin' him with gentle acts,
"You wrong, boy," she says to him,
With an oath so strong, it's a win.

May Heaven above and earth below,
With Styx's waters, can't you know?
I swear I mean you no harm, no way,
Just advice for the island getaway.

I'm dealin' straight up, no lies here,
My heart's not made of iron, clear?
I'm sorry for you, no need to fear,
Calypso's got you, have no fear.

"Hey there Ulysses, you're finally awake!
I hope the food I served you wasn't fake.
I know you're probably missing your wife,
But I'll keep you company, that's just life.

I have ambrosia and nectar as my own cuisine,
But for mortals, I serve what they have seen.
I know you have to leave, it's such a tease,
But I'll make sure you leave here with ease.

I couldn't help but notice, you're such a snack,
I'm sorry, I know that's a bit of a hack.
But seriously, your looks are on fleek,
It's no wonder why you're so unique.

Stay with me forever, it'll be so lit,
We'll Netflix and chill, it's worth a bit.
I'll treat you like a king, just trust in me,
Together we can rule the galaxy."

Yo Ulysses, son of Laertes, you wanna head home straightaway?
Good luck and all, but lemme just say,
If you only knew the hardships ahead,
Stay with me instead,
I'll make you immortal, you'll never die,
Forget about that wife, don't you even try.
I'm just sayin', don't expect her to match,
My beauty's on point, like that savage cat scratch.
No mortal woman can compare with me,
You're welcome to stay with my divinity.

Yo, Ulysses, don't be alarmed 
I know your wife Penelope can’t charm 
Like a goddess, tall and divine 
But crossing seas, she's not worth the dime 

Don’t worry, I’ll hype up your tale 
From troubles, you cannot bail 
If some god decides to knock you 
You'll still slay, and we'll applaud you 

Infinite trouble you've faced 
By land and sea, no time to waste 
You're ready to take on this test 
And rise above like the very best 

So keep going, keep fighting 
The end is near, your journey exciting 
We'll root for you, our favorite Greek 
To get home, and success, you'll seek! #Blessed #GreekMythology #KeepFighting

As the sun took its leave and the dark did embark,  
The duo retreated to the back of the park  
And as the night drew in, they got ready for bed,  
Laid down their heads and rested their tired heads.  

No need for a tent, they had this cave instead,  
They got comfy and cozy, ready to hit the hay,  
But little did they know what would happen next in this app,  
Something epic was about to go down, like that Drake snap.

As Dawn's fingertips kissed the sky,
Ulysses got dressed, not a single shy.
In a dress light like a feather,
Calypso looked stunning, almost like she's from another weather.

Thinking of a way to speed his fate,
She gave him bronze axe that was first rate.
Sharpened on both sides and oh so fine,
With an olive-wood handle, it was totally divine.

She provided him with a sharp adze,
Showing him where the largest trees blaze.
He cut poplar, pine and oak,
All seasoned well, perfect for a sailor's folk.

After twenty trees cut down, he adzed them smooth,
Squaring them by rule in a perfect groove.
Calypso came back with augers to bore,
And so, they built a raft by the shore.

Fitted the timbers with bolts and rivets,
Making it broad and the beams have no limits.
A yard arm mast was not missed,
A rudder to steer and a deck in the midst.

As a protection from the waves' motion,
The raft was fenced with wicker as an ocean notion.
The sails were made with Calypso's linen,
All fastened with braces, enough to make you grinnin'.

And as the crowning touch to his rolling throne,
He drew the raft down the ocean with levers unknown.

Ulysses, the great sailor man,
Traveled across the ocean span.
But stranded now on Calypso's isle,
His heart was down, he lost his smile.

For four long days, he worked with might,
And finished his raft by day and night.
Calypso washed him up so clean,
And gave him clothes, like a cool teen.

And for his journey, she gave him wine,
Filled to the brim, it was so fine.
A bigger bag of water, she gave him quick,
And a wallet full of food, did the trick.

The wind was fair and warm for him,
As Ulysses' journey was about to begin.
He watched the Pleiads with all his might,
And Bootes late-setting under starry night.

Ulysses sailed skillfully day and night,
Guided by rudder, he was quite a sight.
He never closed his eyes, he was wide-awake,
Keeping to the left, the bear doesn't shake.

Seven and ten days did Ulysses ride,
Over the vast sea, with the wind by his side.
On the eighteenth day, the mountains did appear,
The Phaeacians' land was ever so near.

With the shield-like mountains in his sight,
Ulysses was filled with sheer delight.

Yo Neptune, just got back from the Ethiopians,
Saw Ulysses sailing, and it was vexin',
This dude's been in all sorts of calamities,
But now he's headed to Phaeacians, such veracity.

The gods changed their minds while I was away,
And Ulysses is close to reaching their bay,
But don't think he'll make it out unscathed,
Plenty of trouble ahead, feeling quite depraved.

It's like that meme where the car hits someone,
Ulysses keeps getting into trouble for fun,
But like a true hero, he'll fight until the end,
And all his obstacles he will transcend.

Yo, listen up, this is quite a tale,
Ulysses on a ship, braving the gale.
He grasped his trident, stirred up the sea,
Sending every wind to create a catastrophe.

From East, South, North, and West they came,
And Ulysses' heart filled with fear and shame.
"I'm in trouble," he said to himself in dismay,
"Calypso was right, the sea is my foe today."

Jove blackened the sky with his clouds,
And the winds raised the sea, strong and proud.
Ulysses feared for his life, safe to perish,
Regretting he wasn't in Troy, with the Danaans to cherish.

If only he had died that day,
When Achilles' body on the ground did lay,
A proper burial and honourable fame,
But now his life is at stake, a pitiable shame.

Dude, Ulysses was in for a ride
The waves attacked with a force he couldn't abide
The hurricane was so strong it broke the mast
And sent Ulysses flying, like a shipwreck cast

Underwater he struggled, clothes weighing him down
But Ulysses didn't falter or drown
He spat out the seawater that tasted so bitter
And swam towards his raft, with movements like a jitter

With determination he climbed on board, avoiding the deep
The sea played rough, tossing his raft like a game of keep
It spun Ulysses around, like thistledown in the wind
But he wouldn't give up, not even a bit chagrined

All around, the winds played their own game, passing the raft between them
But Ulysses held on, as the sea raged and condemned
This hero wasn't going to let the ocean defeat him
With steadfast resilience, he fought and didn't dim

In the end, Ulysses emerged triumphant, surviving the stormy fight
And proved to us all, that with courage and might
We can overcome the greatest obstacles in our path
And make it through, even when we're feeling the ocean's wrath. 

#notallheroes wear capes #oceanadventures #battlingthewaves #survivor #nevergiveup

Dang, Ulysses was in a tight spot
But then Ino, real OG, saw he needed the help that she's got
She once was human, now she's a marine goddess by fate 
And saw Ulysses struggling, had to intervene and help him escape
Rose up like a sea-gull from the waves so chill 
And took a seat on the raft, determined to keep him from a watery spill

"Yo, my brotha, why is Neptune so mad at you? He's causing chaos, but babe, don't you worry, he ain't gonna slay you. You seem like a smart dude, so listen to me, strip down and let your raft sail away with the breeze, swim to the Phaecian coast and you'll be in the clear, you'll see. And wait up, take my veil and wrap it round your chest, this enchantment will protect you, put your mind to rest. Once you hit land, fling it far into the ocean blue, and continue on your journey anew." With her words so wise, she passed him her magical veil, then dove outta sight like a bird, this girl was no frail.

Yo, Ulysses was in quite the perplexity
He thought, "Is this a god trying to wreck me?"
Saying to leave his raft, to quit and flee
But he knew better, as smart as can be

"I'll stick to my raft, her timbers still strong
Won't leave just yet for the land she said I belong
Still quite the distance, I'll face the throng
And only swim when my raft is no longer long"

So Ulysses remained steadfast and true
Resisting the temptations, a smart move to pursue
And when the time comes, he'll know what to do
Whether to swim or float, his decisions anew

Yo, Ulysses was stuck in a bind,  
Feeling torn between heart and mind.  
But Neptune wasn't down to wait,  
He brought a wave to seal his fate. 

The raft was wrecked, no hope in sight,  
But Ulysses refused to go down without a fight.  
He got up on a plank, feeling brave,  
And rode the waves like he was on a big rave. 

He shed his clothes, got ready to swim,  
Tied the veil tight under his limbs.  
He dived in, ready for the long haul,  
Hoping to find safety down the shore. 

King Neptune watched with a wry smile,  
Said to himself, "Let's wait awhile.  
This won't be easy, he's in for a ride,  
But let him swim till he finds the other side." 

With a heavy heart and a weary mind,  
Ulysses swam, leaving death behind.  
Towards the horizon he strove,  
Hoping to make friends with those who grove. 

Neptune drove away, content and pleased,  
For now, his heart was finally appeased.  
Ulysses battle had just begun,  
But he had the strength of a thousand suns.

Oh dang, Minerva's got Ulysses' back,
Stopping all the winds except one track,
She let a North breeze blow oh so strong,
So our boy Ulysses could reach his safe home.

She's like a boss, controlling Mother Nature,
One look from her and even winds can't betray ya,
Now Ulysses is cruising through the sea,
Feeling hype like he's earned royalty.

The land of the Phaeacians is where he's headed,
He must be relieved he's not stranded and dreaded,
Thanks to Minerva he's almost there,
Safe and sound with no need to despair.

Our girl Minerva knows what time it is,
She's unstoppable like the internet biz,
So let's all flex like her and be unstoppable too,
Like a boss who knows just what to do.

Ulysses was in a tough spot, adrift with no hope,
The waves were high and he was left to cope.
For two long days and nights he drifted on the sea,
With no sight of land, feeling lost and lonely.

But on the third day, a miracle happened,
The wind calmed down and he saw land beckon.
Ulysses swam with all his strength and might,
To set his feet on solid ground that night.

But the sea was rough and the rocks were high,
The waves crashed hard with a thunderous cry.
No harbours or shelters that could save his ship,
He was left with nothing but the land and mountain tips.

Still, Ulysses didn't give up, he pushed through,
Just like we do when we have a goal in view.
He fought his way through the rocky shore,
And finally found safety, his journey was no more. 

It's just like that meme, when you feel so lost,
But suddenly you find your way, no matter the cost.
Ulysses landed on the shore, like a boss,
And proved to us all, that even in waves, we can't get tossed.

Yo, Ulysses was feeling real blue,
After such a long swim, he saw land, woo!
But the coast was harsh, with no good sight,
No footing on the rocks, everything so tight.

He was afraid he'd be thrown so bad,
Against the rocks that were oh so sad,
If he dared to leave the water so grand,
Oh gee, he just wanted to find dry land!

But if he swam further in search of hope,
Nature might just say, "Hey man, nope!"
With waves and winds and monsters to face,
No wonder he's feeling in a wild chase.

But don't worry Ulysses, don't be afraid,
You've got this, don't be dismayed.
Just keep going and don't give in,
You'll make it to the shore and you'll win!

As he was stuck between the reefs,
His fate seemed to cause him griefs.
Caught by the waves, smacked by the rocks,
His journey showed many paradox.

Good thing Minerva appeared,
His fate, she had instantly cleared.
He held onto the rocks with might,
Waiting 'til the wave takes flight.

However, this wasn't the end,
The tide pulled him away, no time to spend.
Like a polypus sucker to bed,
His hands, torn and bleeding, feeling dead.

The rocks tore his skin with sheer power,
As the waves carried him far like a tower.
He was dragged deep, deep underwater,
A scene that left him breathless, like no other!

Ulysses was in deep despair,
But Minerva came to help and care.
He swam and swam, his fate not clear,
But kept his wits amidst his fear.

He looked for a haven or a spit,
To shield him from waves that wouldn't quit.
Then he found a river mouth,
Where no rocks stirred, just a gentle south.

He felt a current, cold and strong,
But knew he couldn't wait for long.
He prayed to the gods above,
For a chance to catch his breath and move.

And with their might, they led him true,
Towards a land that's bright and new.
Ulysses knew his journey's far,
But he'll keep going like a shooting star.

Oh, snap! Listen up, King, whoever you might be,
I'm in deep water and I'm calling out prayerfully.
I got lost at sea, and now I'm in distress,
Please Neptune, save me, I'm in a hot mess!

I'm reaching out, straight to your stream,
Hoping for mercy, like a millennial's dream.
I'm here on my knees, riverhood, begging for aid,
Don't let me down, King, I'm in need of this crusade. 

I'm just a mere mortal, lost at sea,
But with your expertise, I know I can flee.
So please, have some sympathy for me,
And grant me mercy, your humble suppliant, OK?

Bro, listen up, this tale's not done
Ulysses, tired and swollen, almost won
He was saved by a goddess, Ino was her name
A scarf of hers kept him from going down in fame

The river was mad, the waves were high
Ulysses had to swim, had to give it a try
But Ino saw him struggling, gasping for air
So she calmed the water, helped him out of there

Ino gave him a scarf, to keep him safe and dry
Ulysses was grateful, and he let out a sigh
But the sea had taken its toll, he couldn't stand
So he fell to the ground, washed up onto the sand

He tossed Ino's scarf back into the sea
It floated gently, gracefully, like a bee
Ino caught it, with a wave so fine
She smiled and thought, "He'll do just fine"

Ulysses rested, feeling warm and free
Thankful that he was back on solid ground, you see
He kissed the earth, so bountiful and rich
And that's how he got saved, without a glitch!

Bro, he sat on the riverbed, feeling so low,
Wondering how it'll all end, feeling so woe.
Staying here through the night, oh what a plight
Cold and damp, could make him end with a fright.

But if he climbs the hill, in search of a thrill,
Finds a thicket, and takes shelter at will,
Resting there for the night, away from the fight,
A good sleep guaranteed, under stars shining bright.

But wait, a savage beast, could make his relief, 
Into a tragedy, that's beyond belief,
Could make him a feast, before he could cease,
And put an end to his life, and steal his peace.

So now what's he to do, dude needs a clue,
To fight or to escape, to stay or to pursue?
The choice is up to him, to sink or to swim,
But beware bro, 'cos life is no whim.

As he pondered his choices, and listened for noises,
He sees a meme, that brings him new choices,
"YOLO," it reads with a hashtag so bold,
Life is short, live it up, before you get old.

Yo, Ulysses found the woods he sought,
A spot where two olive branches were caught,
One grafted and one a sucker free,
Together they formed a dense canopy.

No squally wind nor sun too bright,
Could pierce the cover which seemed just right,
Ulysses crawled under that olive tree,
And began to make himself a bed of leaves with glee.

The place was a mess, dead leaves everywhere,
But Ulysses knew how to make it somewhat bearable to bear,
He heaped up the leaves until he made a bed,
Enough to cover two or three men instead.

Just as a man, far from any neighbor,
Hides a hot brand to save himself labor,
Ulysses covered himself with leaves so green,
As sweet sleep by Minerva, goddess of wisdom was foreseen.

Alright, alright, gather around,
Let me tell you a story that's sure to astound,
It's got everything you could ever ask for,
And it's straight from the viral folklore.

Once upon a time in the land of the net,
Lived a person we'll call "Internet-Pet",
They were famous online, their reach was vast,
Everyone knew them, from first to last.

One day they posted a pic on Insta,
And let me tell ya, it was a real winfa,
The likes poured in, the comments did too,
People couldn't get enough, no matter what they do.

Soon enough, a brand reached out,
They wanted Internet-Pet to rep their clout,
They offered them cash, and free swag,
Internet-Pet was like, "Yo, that's rad!"

So they made a deal, and signed on the line,
Soon enough, they were on top, it was so divine,
Everyone wanted to know their secret,
But all they could say was, "It's just the net, don't you see it?"

And now they're living large, with fame and fortune,
Their name's known worldwide, not just in a portion,
So take it from me, and don't you forget,
The internet can make you famous, just like Internet-Pet.

BOOK VI

Y'all, Ulysses was tired and crashed in sleep,
Minerva bounced to Phaecia, real deep,
Phaecians came from a hood near the Cyclopes,
The big guys robbed them, they had no hopes.

Nausithous, their king, saved their lives,
He knew he had to make some drives.
Built temples, homes, and a strong wall,
He passed and Alcinous answered the call.

Alcinous had the heaven's wisdom,
To guide his island, he had the vision.
Minerva went to Alcinous' place,
To help Ulysses, link up the case.

Oh, snap! It was quite the sight,
Nausicaa, sleeping sweetly through the night.
Minerva changed her form, it's true, 
And appeared as Dymas' daughter, who
Was besties with Nausicaa, no less,
And looked like a sea captain, we must confess.

Approaching her bed, like a whisper in the air,
Minerva spoke to the girl without a care:
"Sup homie, it's your girl here,
Just dropping by to spread some cheer.
You and I, we're tight like glue,
So, listen up, I've got news for you."

Nausicaa stirred, and rubbed her eyes,
As Minerva continued with no surprise:
"Your laundry, girl, it needs a spin,
Your clothes are looking kinda grim.
Tomorrow go and wash them, my dear,
And don't forget to bring some beer."

Nausicaa woke up with a start,
Wondering who this girl was with the big heart.
She realized in shock that it was Minerva, the wise,
And listened with admiration in her eyes.
"Thanks girl, you're so chill and rad,
I'll take your advice, it's not that bad."

Hey Nausicaa, what's up with the clutter?
We need to get your dress game looking better 
With your wedding day approaching it's prime time 
Best believe you gotta be looking so fine 
You gotta shine bright like a diamond, sis 
Make your parents proud, it's your time to bliss 
So let's do laundry tomorrow, gotta make it neat 
I'll help so you'll be ready to swiflty beat 
Your potential suitors coming to court 
They're already seeing you as a great sport 
Let your dad know to bring that wagon 
Don't wanna be stuck walking 
We gotta wash those rugs and robes 
And get rid of all those nasty strobes

Oh dang, Minerva went to Olympus,
where it's lit and the gods are  anonymous.
No wind, no snow, just everlasting light,
They be chillin' up there, living right.

That's where the girl got her instructions,
Straight from Minerva, no misconstructions.
Now the goddess is kickin' back,
in the heavens, where it's always jackin'

The blessed gods are illuminated for days,
While mortals down here fall into a daze.
But we don't mind, we got memes to share,
And internet slang to keep us aware.

"Yo, Dad and Mom, check it - I had a dream that's so sick,
And I just had to come and share it, it's really quick!
I dreamt that I was doing laundry by the river,
But then some nudies came and made me shiver.

I didn't know what was going on,
Until I saw a hero in the dawn.
He was wrecked, but then he woke,
And I swear, it was like he was woke.

He asked for my help and I gave it,
And that's how my dream ended, legit!"

Her father said, "Sweetheart, that's insane!
We've gotta let the gods guide us, it's plain!
But when the council's done, we'll arrange
To take you and the maids to the riverside range.

We'll leave you there with laundry to do,
And make sure there's some food with you.
Just stay away from the men, okay?
They might be hot, but they'll get in the way."

Aye aye, sis, I feel your plight 
Dirty clothes can be quite a fright
But fret not, for I got you
We'll get that wagon, nice and new

Clean linen is what we all crave
Especially when we hit the rave
The council meetings need us sharp
We'll look so fly we'll set them apart

Married or not, clean is still best
I'll get that wagon, I won't rest
We'll do laundry like a pro
And then we'll dance, don't you know

We'll make those clothes so fresh and clean, 
You'll think they're straight out of a dream 
We'll have the best dressed family there 
And people will be like "woah, that's quite rare"

Oh my gosh, did you hear?
This girl's father is making her cheer!
He said she can have whatever she desires,
Including mules and a wagon to fulfil her entire attire.

No talk about her impending nuptials,
But we know that's what's got her in crucial.
Her father wants to make sure she's all set,
And he's got her covered, you can bet.

A strong wagon with a body, that's a start,
It won't be a hassle to cart all her shopping carts.
This girl's got it all figured out,
Thanks to her dad, no need to pout.

But what's the tea on her wedding day?
She's keeping it quiet, can't cuss or say.
All we know is that her dad's got her back,
And she's got her mules, ready to attack!

Yo, this queen's mom is slaying the game,
Can't believe this is all for laundry, what a shame.
The servants got a wagon and some mules,
And Nausicaa packed some snacks, no rules.
They even brought a goat skin full of wine,
These Greeks got it going, it's really looking fine.
She got on the wagon, with clothes and girls,
Hope they have a good time, and they enjoy their whirls.
Mules hooves clattered and they moved so fast,
Gotta hand it to them, their ride is built to last.

They went down to the water, looking lit and fly,
With pure water to clean clothes, no need to try.
Unharnessed the mules, let them graze on the side,
While they washed all the clothes, took dirt for a ride.

Got 'em clean, put them by the beach to dry,
And washed themselves, smellin' like olive oil high.
After lunch they started playin' ball,
With Nausicaa singing, chillin' overall.

Like Diana in the mountains, huntin' game,
Nymphs with her, all with a lil bit of fame.
Leto cheered her daughter, who stood taller than all,
Like Nausicaa with her handmaids, fly and all.

Oh dang, Minerva's got a plan so smart,
To introduce Ulysses to a girl with heart,
Tossing a ball, it goes astray,
And wakes up Ulysses to start his day.

The maids all scream, the noise they make,
Ulysses wonders what's the mistake,
He rises from his leafy bed,
And ponders what lies ahead.

A handsome girl, to guide the way,
To the city of Phaeacians, come what may,
Ulysses excited, he cannot wait,
To meet this girl, and seal his fate.

With Minerva on his side,
Nothing can stop this hero's ride,
All aboard the Ulysses train,
Ready to conquer, to glory attain. 

#NotThatSerious #MakingHistory #PhaeaciansFTW

Yo, my dude, where you at?
You're in a place that's lit, no cap!
Are they cruel? Are they kind?
Let's find out and unwind, in this state of mind!

I hear young women's voices,
Sounding like those of the goddesses.
Maybe you're in a fantasy land,
Or in a place where the vibes are grand.

Let's see if we can take a peek,
And explore what lies beneath.
Are they savage and wild,
Or hospitable with a smile?

Let's find out and break the ice,
And have an adventure, it'll be nice.
Maybe we'll meet some new friends,
And our story will never end!

Yo, Ulysses, my man, in a rough place
Naked, hungry, with fear on his face.
Looking like a lion on the prowl,
Seeking for prey in the wild and howl.
The young women fled, except for one
Alcinous' daughter, standing like a ton.
Minerva must've blessed her with courage divine,
To face Ulysses like a valiant feline.
Should he kneel at her feet or stay away,
And ask for clothes and the town's way?
He thought it best to plead from afar,
With words so sweet, like a shooting star.

Oh boy, you're quite the charmer,
I'm sure you think you're doing no harm here, 
But let me tell you something, 
As I speak into your ear. 

You're lost and stranded, we see, 
Twenty days lost at sea, 
You look at me in admiration, 
As I stand here with perfection nation. 

Are you suggesting I'm a goddess or divine?
That would be quite an accolade of a find!
Maybe a daughter of Zeus or Apollo, 
Your imagination must be on the overflow. 

But alas, my dear, I am just a mortal, 
Thriving on this earth with a strut that's immortal. 
My parents and siblings, yes they're a kind, 
But lucky are those who hold my heart in bind. 

Your comparison to a young palm tree excites,
Just like a sweet meme that ignites. 
I dare say, such flattery is rare, 
You find it hard to breathe and gasp for air. 

You've weathered the seas and pounding waves, 
Fighting with fate, as it leads and paves. 
But here you are, thrown upon our shore, 
While the heavens try to settle a score. 

I sense a great distress in you, 
As if the answer is far overdue, 
But here's my hand to lift you up, 
And boy, that should be enough.

Aw yeah, my queen, hear my plea
You're the only one I see
I'm new to these parts, don't you know?
Could ya help me out, let's go

Lead me to your town, show me the way
And if you brought a cloth today
Let me use it to wrap my clothes
So I'm not in tatters, heaven knows

I wish ya all the best, my dear
A happy home, a husband near
When man and wife are on one page
It throws off haters, brings joy to our crew, it's all the rage!

Yo, stranger, you seem chill and kind,
Luck’s a mystery, it's so hard to define,
Jove decides who gets success and who won’t,
So take what you’ve been given, let go of the taunts.

Now that you're here on this unknown land,
I promise you clothes, with a helping hand,
I'll take you to our town, it's not far away,
Our people are Phaeacians, that's all I gotta say.

Alcinous, that's my dad, he rules with all his might,
He’s our powerhouse, he’s our shining knight.
Come with me, you'll be alright,
And we'll make sure your stay is bright.

Yo, she called her crew and said
"Don't run away or act unfed
Can't you see this guy needs aid
Don't let fear make you afraid"

She knew he wasn't a robber or murderer
For they lived on a land jutting out fur
They were the Phaeacians, always sure
That they were safe, Jove's protection a pure lure

"This man is lost, he's in a tight fix
Let's be kind and offer some drinks and a mix"
Strangers and foreigners are under Jove's care
So give him food and water to repair

Wash him in a stream, find a spot that's choosey
And remember girls, hospitality is groovy!"

The maids ran away, like they just spotted a beyblade
Calling back and forth, like one big brigade
They made Ulysses sit down, where it was safe
Gave him a shirt and cloak, with haste
A golden cruse of oil, they did bestow
Telling him to wash, in the stream's flow
Ulysses spoke up, wanting to be polite
"Please stand to the side, out of sight"
"I need to wash off this brine so old,
And coat myself in sweet, sweet gold"
"I can't wash with y'all here,
Sorry to say, let's make that clear"
"I'm embarrassed to strip down,
In front of all you good-looking gals in town"

Ulysses was an OG who just made it through,
Taking a dip in the stream, getting rid of that salt too.
He scrubbed his back and broad shoulders with care,
And got himself clean, looking fresh and rare.

After that, he put on some new threads,
Supplied by the girl, with oils for his head.
Then Minerva stepped in, made him taller and stronger,
Like a hyacinth blossom, his hair even longer.

With skills like a workman who studied all art,
Ulysses was glowing, a masterpiece from the heart.
He sat on the beach looking quite refined,
Trapping the girl's attention, she was blind.

Mesmerized by his young and handsome face,
The girl whispered to her aides with grace.

Wait, peeps, lemme speak my mind,
This dude we're seeing, he's one of a kind,
The gods must've sent him, I say,
'Cause his looks are heavenly in every way.

At first, I thought he was meh,
But now I can't get enough of his swag!
I wish my future bae is as fly as he,
And sticks around like our bro, Odysseus, you see?

But first, let's offer him some grub,
And quench his thirst with a drink that's not a dud.
Then sit back and enjoy his divine demeanor,
Y'all, this guy's a real mood, if you know what I mean-ah.

Yo, Ulysses, don't be confused,
But we've got places to be, don't be refuse.
Hop on the wagon and let's go for a ride,
We'll get you home, no need to hide.

We packed you some food, so eat up quick,
And drink some water, you'll feel slick.
Nausicaa's driving, she's got the wheel,
We'll get you home, it's no big deal.

The journey ahead may be long,
But we'll use our time to sing a song.
Together we'll make it, we'll have some fun,
No worries, Ulysses, our mission's just begun. 

*insert meme*

Aye aye, said he, girl you've got it right,
I'll follow your lead, with all my might,
It's lit to meet the Phaecians, cool as ice,
I hope I won't mess up, and pay the price.

I'll walk behind with the maids and crew,
And maybe even catch some Pokemon too,
Fields and farm lands I'll follow with glee,
Hoping that they'll all be friends with me.

When we reach the town, it's time to flex,
Meet the cool kids and pay our respects,
A high wall around, to keep us all safe,
And we'll see ships, with strength and grace.

There's a temple for Neptune, by the way,
And a market for ship's gear every day,
No bows or arrows, no need to stress,
This sea-faring nation knows how to impress.

Oh wow, you're in a pickle, my friend,
This gossip might never seem to end,
Those Phaeacians got haters and teasers,
Dissing like internet trolls and teaser pleasers.

You're chillin' with Nausicaa, you're handsome and cool,
But the locals might judge you as just another fool,
They think you're just a sailor or a god,
And Nausicaa, as usual, is completely smitten and awed.

They might slander you fam, and spread the news,
And it'll be all over like last night's booze,
You're afraid of feeling some major shame,
Like when your tweets get blasted for all to claim.

It's clear as day that these worries are real,
It's like you spilled tea and now you gotta deal,
But don't sweat it bro, trust in your lady's heart,
She'll keep her cool and never let y'all drift apart.

Don't worry about the shade thrown at ya,
Nausicaa will handle what they say, oh la la,
Honestly, let them snapchat and take pics of you,
You're hot and fashionable, ain't nothing they can prove.

Yo, peaeps listen to me,
I'll help you out of this misery.
If you wanna go back home,
Don't go around like a roaming gnome.

I got the hookup, the perfect plan,
You'll reach your homeland like a boss, man.
See a beautiful grove of poplars,
By the roadside, just like scholars.

Wait there, chill for a while,
Till we finish our work with a smile.
My dad's house is one of a kind,
A child can show you, it's not hard to find.

Walk through the outer court,
Cross the inner court like a sport.
My mother's spinning purple wool,
Maids around her, a vibe so cool.

Don't worry about my dad, sitting like a god,
Just touch my mom's knees, give it a nod,
She'll do the magic to bring you home,
No matter what country, no more to roam. 

Now, that's the tea, you can trust me,
With this plan, soon you'll be free.

Okay, hear me out, this is quite the feat,
Ulysses and his maids were walking down the street,
The mules were on point, they were drawn to perfection,
Their hooves hitting the pavement in a rhythmic connection.

Our girl was the boss, cracking her whip with ease,
Making sure the pace was right, nothing to tease,
And as the sun set, they reached Minerva's grove,
Ulysses sat down, and prayed to her above.

He asked for her guidance, for her wisdom and might,
To protect and aid him through his perilous plight,
And with a smile on her face, Minerva appeared,
To answer his prayer, make his worries disappear.

Y'all, this is straight up divine intervention,
Like when Drake drops a new song, it gets my attention,
Ulysses is lucky to have Minerva on his team,
This powerful duo is a force to be seen.

Yo, yo, yo, Athena hear me out,  
I'm in a pickle, that's no doubt.  
Neptune tried to wreck me, not cool,  
Now I need friends, I'm no fool.  

Daughter of Jove, with an Aegis-bearing,  
Lend me your ears, my luck needs sharing.  
Please have mercy, and show some love,  
I need Phaecians to take me above.  

Unweariable, hear my plea,  
I need some bros to set me free.  
Friends that'll take me in with glee,  
And show me how good hospitality can be.  

So, Athena, don't be shy,  
Grant my wish, give me wings to fly.  
Take me where my heart can sigh,  
And make this odyssey one to amplify.  

#NoShadeButNeptuneIsAnnoying.

Oh dang, Ulysses prayed all night,
But Minerva warned, "It's not alright."
She heard his plea, but had to cloak,
Hiding from Neptune's angry stroke.

The sea god rages, he won't quit,
Trying to halt Ulysses' trip.
Minerva knows this fiery strife,
So she keeps hidden, out of sight.

But she'll help Ulysses in his plight,
Guide him towards his home so bright,
With memes and slang, she'll light the way,
And make sure he's okay, okay?

Yo, what's poppin' fam, let me tell you a story
It's gonna be lit, trust me, not at all boring
It's about this dude, who's a total mood
And the crazy things he did, oh my god, dude

He woke up one day and said "yeet"
I'm gonna go on an adventure, something sweet
So off he went, to the great unknown
With his squad, they were all in the zone

They traveled to places, seen only in memes
The sights were dope, and the vibes supreme
They even went to a galaxy far far away
And met Yoda, who had some wise words to say

But then, things got a little cray
They stumbled upon a dragon, who just wanted to play
They battled it out, with swords and some wit
And in the end, they won, no need to quit

The dude and his squad, they were queens and kings
They celebrated their victory, and did some sick things
They partied all night, like it was the end of the year
And the dude bellowed "YEET", without any fear

So, that's the story, my fam, hope you liked it
Now go out there, and live your life, and just be a lit kit.

BOOK VII

Yo, Ulysses was on his knees, praying to the gods with ease,
But Nausicaa drove on with the mules, make no mistake, no fees.
Arrived at her crib, her brothers were there,
Looking like gods, with good hair.

They took the mules out of the wagon with grace,
Packed all the clothes, it was quite the chase.
As for Nausicaa, she went to her room,
Where the fire was lit, and the vibes go vroom.

Eurymedusa was the servant's name,
She was brought from Apeira, not a claim to fame.
She was given to Alcinous as a prize,
But she took care of Nausicaa, no lies.

She brought supper to Nausicaa with care,
And that's what really happened, this is no dare.
So sit tight, and maybe you'll hear,
More stories full of culture, no fear!

"Aye, what's up, little Miss?
Got any tea in that pitcher, sis?
I'm just tryna make it to the town,
But I don't wanna get knocked down.

Minerva, is that you in disguise?
Hiding me from these Phaecian guys?
I appreciate the extra help,
I don't wanna be treated like a whelp.

These people seem a little too proud,
I wanna blend in with the crowd.
But if they ask who I am,
What's my story, what's my jam?

I'll just have to come up with a tale,
Maybe something that will prevail.
But for now, let's just keep walking,
And Minerva, thanks for the talking."

Oh snap, you're a stranger here,
But don't you fear, I'm oh so near.
King Alcinous's house? No biggie,
I'll guide you there like a true millennial prodigy.

You're in distress? That's not cool,
But don't worry, I won't give you a ridicule.
I got you, fam, don't you stress,
Together, we'll handle this crazy mess.

You're a foreigner, that's all good,
I'll show you the way, like I should.
This town and country may seem strange,
But with me as your guide, things will change.

So let's get lit and start the journey,
To King Alcinous's house, it won't be blurry.
Don't forget to snap some pics along the way,
For your Insta story, have a great day!

Aye aye, Minerva, you're the queen of the town
I'll follow you like a lost puppy hound
But shush your lips and don't say a thing
Not a word, not a peep, no questions to bring

These seafaring people don't like strangers so bold
They might leave us in the dust, out in the cold
They sail the seas like it's no biggie
With ships so sleek, faster than a Wiggy

We'll make it to Alcinous's house with ease
Just trust in me, I'll make sure we please
So hold your horses, we'll stick to the plan
And glide through this town like we're on Instagram

Oh my goodness, Ulysses, can you even believe
The beauty of this city, it's like a dream, you'll achieve
Their harbors, their ships, oh it's all so grand
And don't get me started on the walls and castle stands

But wait, hold up, don't let them see your face
Minerva's got your back, she's put you in a secret hiding place
They won't even know you're here, it's all good
Just follow my lead, do what I say, as you should

And now, behold, the palace of the king
A sight so magnificent, it'll make your heart sing
Minerva, with her wisdom, to Ulysses spoke
Get ready, my dude, for what's about to go down, it's no joke

Yo dad, check out this pad,
Where some VIPs make people glad.
Don't be scared, just go straight up,
Boldness wins, don't interrupt.
The queen's the one you need to find,
Arete's her name, they're intertwined.
Descended from Neptune, oh so great,
Nausithous and Periboea, first rate.
Even the mom was drop-dead fine,
Euroymedon's youngest, divine.
Giants, he ruled with all his might,
But his fate got twisted, not so bright.

Yo, listen up, this tale's insane
Of Neptune's actions, we feel the pain
He slept with his daughter, and the result was
A great son, Nausithous, who made no fuss

Nausithous had two sons, Rhexenor and Alcinous
Apollo struck one dead, leaving Arete for us
Alcinous married her, and to this day
She's honored like no other woman, y'all, okay?

Arete keeps house like a true queen
She's the baddest chick that we've ever seen
With Neptune as her grandpa, and Apollo in tow
Her family history is quite the show!

Dang, this lady Penelope
Is respected, I gotta say
Her children love her, don't play
Alcinous and the whole town
Think she's a goddess, won't bring her down

Good woman in her heart and head
Her friends and their hubs, she'll help instead
Win her over, and you'll be blessed
Friends and home, you'll return, no stress

Penelope's the queen of goal-setting
Helping with disputes, never forgetting
With her by your side, you'll fly high
Just like that famous bird, blue guy

Oh, listen up, y'all, and hear me clear
A tale of goddesses and kings so dear
Minerva took off, left Scheria behind
And landed in Athens, who treats all like a kind!

Ulysses, meanwhile, took a different path
He arrived at Alcinous' palace, a place so bathed in wealth
In awe, he paused, staring at the bronze entrance
Golden doors, silver pillar, his wonder knew no hindrance

The walls' bronze gleamed like the sun at noon
Blue enamel cornice painted like the stars, he swooned
Every single inch, lavish and rich
The floor was bronze, the lintel silver, gold hook to bewitch!

A sight to behold, a palace so bright
A story so grand with no hint of slight
Both Minerva and Ulysses' path, so different and bold
Yet their journey led them to splendour untold!

Yo, let me tell you 'bout this place,
It's got style, beauty, and grace;
King Alcinous' palace is where it's at,
And those watchdogs of gold and silver are phat.

Seats line the walls, fancily designed,
With coverings that'll surely blow your mind.
The Phaecians dine in luxury and delight
With torches shining all through the night.

These fifty maids are always on the go,
Some grinding grain, some weaving, you know.
Their skills with thread is simply insane,
And they work so hard, it's like a hurricane.

They sail the seas like it's nothing at all,
They know their stuff, never skip a call.
And when it comes to weaving, they're queens,
Thanks to Minerva's teachings, they reach their dreams. 

This place ain't just any palace, it's true,
With all these boss females, what else is new?
So if you're ever in Phaeacia town,
Come and see the badassness go down.

Yo, check it out, outside the gate, 
There’s a garden for us to celebrate, 
Trees, fruits, and flowers you wouldn't believe, 
Pears, poms, and apples that make you feel at ease.

Figs so luscious, olives so divine, 
All year round, they never decline, 
Winter or summer, they stay at their peak, 
So juicy and fresh, you won't find them bleak.

Pear on pear, apple on apple, as you’d expect, 
Fig on fig, and grapes with no reject,
An excellent vineyard, like straight from heaven, 
The perfection of grapes is simply the best sensation!

Two streams go through, with water so cool, 
One turns into ducts, another remains a rule,
The town's people come to draw their water with glee,
From the underground stream that flawlessly decree.

Flowers blooming all year round, 
Ornamented in the most magnificent background,
The gods endowed this place with lots of swank,
King Alcinous is truly in the upper ranks!

Ulysses, my dude, was cruising through the night
Obstructed by darkness, he had no sight
But when he arrived at the Phaeacian house
He saw their leaders worshipping and getting soused

He walked through the court, still concealed
Then saw Arete's knees, and made his appeal
As he grabbed them, the darkness disappeared
And everyone was shocked, thinking Ulysses reappeared!

They didn't know who he was or what he wanted
But Ulysses spoke up, and everything haunted
He asked for their aid, for a way to go home
And the Phaeacians agreed, they wouldn't let him roam.

Yo, humble vibes, respect to the queen,
I hope your reign remains pristine,
But alas, I'm in distress,
Lost and alone, I confess.

Oh daughter of Rhexenor, what say you?
Can you and your man give me a clue,
A way home to my people and kin,
Where happiness and love reside within?

May heaven bless you and your guests,
The ones with the most, and the ones with less,
May they prosper with long life,
And leave behind no strife.

But now, Queen Arete, hear my plea,
A stranded man looking for a key,
To unlock the door to my homeland,
Where my family and friends make their stand.

Help me out, I pray to thee,
And all the gods above, set me free,
For I've been lost and far away,
But with your help, that'll all sway.

Yo, yo, yo, this is one cool story,
Echeneus, the Phaeacians' elder, all wise and hoary,
Sat down on the hearth, among the ashes,
And they all stayed still, like in some sort of trances.

But then he spoke out, honest and clear,
With wisdom that everyone wanted to hear,
For Echeneus was a hero, and he knew how to impress,
With his excellent speaking skills, he was sure to address.

And even though it may seem a bit bizarre,
I gotta say, "Okay, Boomer," from afar,
For Echeneus' speech may have been great,
But for Gen-Z folks, it's time to update.

Yo, Alcinous, what's your dealio?
Don't you know it ain't cool to have a guest in limbo?
You gotta make him feel at home, like he's primo,
Put some respect on his name, make him a VIP, yo!

Tell him to get up from those ashes,
To sit on a silver stool and make some bashes,
Throw him some wine and water like it's nobody's business,
And let him eat some dinner, not no mediocre dishes.

Jove the lord of thunder is the one to appease,
He takes good care of those who aren't sleaze,
And if you want to keep your status as fleek as can be,
You gotta show this stranger some hospitality.

So don't be a hater, don't be a fool,
Treat your guests right, and don't be uncool,
Alcinous, my man, you gotta represent,
And show this dude some love, 'cause that's what's heaven sent.

When Alcinous heard from Ulysses the tale,
He grabbed his hand without any fail,
And told him to sit by his favorite son,
Laodamas, who was having fun.

A maid then brought him water, so pure,
And Ulysses washed his hands for sure,
Sitting at a clean table with bread and things,
And eating and drinking like ancient kings.

Then Alcinous asked the servant to mix,
A cup of wine for a drink-offer fix,
To the lord of thunder, Jove so mighty,
Protector of suppliants, powerful and flighty.

Yo, listen up fam, let's give it up,
for my boy Pontonous, filling up our cup.
He mixed our wine with water with a flick of the wrist,
then gave it round, ensuring none were missed.

After we drank up and made our libation,
Alcinous spoke with such elation:
"My dudes, we've had a great feast,
now let's hear some stories, and we'll be pleased." 

He leaned back in his chair, looking fly,
expecting tales to make our minds high.
So come on, guys, share your amazing tale,
let's hear your epic journey without fail.

Yo! Phaeacian homies, hear me real quick
You've had your dinner, now go catch some Z's real slick
Tomorrow, I'm throwing a big bash, even bigger than this
For our guest, to honor him and celebrate him in absolute bliss

We gon' talk escort and plan his way back home with care
No inconvenience or harm, our guest shall bear
But once he's back in his crib, it's up to fate
He'll go through the motions, just like the rest of us, mate

Perhaps, he's a god in disguise, in human skin and bones
But that ain't common, for the divine beings on their thrones
Usually, they're upfront when we're offering grand feasts
They'd munch and party just like one of our own, with similar beats

But Phaeacians, we're not so different, we too can strive for greatness
Been next to the cyclopes and giants, and still keep our traditions up and ageless!

Yo, Alcinous, don't be absurd
I'm just like you guys, I haven't been cured
Of my problems, both bodily and mentally
You'd think my life's worse, you'd see

But still, let me gobble up this feast
For hunger's a beast that cannot be ceased
Even amidst grief and sorrow
My stomach's demanding food for tomorrow

But you guys, carry on with aiding me
To reach my home, that's where I wanna be
I'll be content with death, no reason to roam
Once I've glimpsed my possessions and kingdom

Let's eat and drink, focus on the here and now
Leave our woes, let's be present in the chow
And help me reach my desired destination
Despite life's trials and tribulations

Yo, Arete, lemme tell you, it's true,
This stranger's story seems wack but it'll make you go ooh!
He's from a land where the sun rises but doesn't set,
Travelled so far, I bet he's got the world in debt.

Those dope clothes he's wearing are not a lie,
Your maids and you made them, ain't that fly?
But who he really is still a mystery,
So listen up, and I'll spill the tea.

He's been through it all, this we know for sure,
Fighting sea monsters and gods, it makes one's heart pure.
But he's man enough to endure the pain,
From his trials and tribulations he has so much to gain.

So, Arete and Alcinous, give him the best,
We gotta show him some hospitality, let him rest.
And who knows, maybe he'll help us out,
With his strength and cunning, there's no room for doubt.

Oh wow, Calypso's island is where I'm at,
Ulysses landed here after quite a bat.
Jove hit his ship hard, it couldn't cope,
Making it impossible to safely steer or hope.

Nine days he clung onto the keel in despair,
And then, on the tenth, Calypso found him there.
Once on the isle, she loved him so,
Wanted him to stay forever and never grow.

She thought immortality was the key,
But Ulysses wanted to leave and be free.
Girl, Calypso was so nice to him,
But he needed to move on for things to begin.

Now Ulysses wants to leave the place,
Keep on fighting the gods just in case.
Ain't no goddess gonna keep him down,
He's a wanderlust king who wears the crown!

Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout a dude named Odysseus, he went through hell.
He stayed on Calypso's island for seven whole years,
And trust me, he shed enough tears.

But finally, she let him go of her own free will,
Maybe cuz Jove told her to or she had her fill.
She gave him a raft stocked with bread and wine,
And some fresh clothes that he looked oh-so-fine.

He sailed for ten days, then caught sight of land,
But Neptune, he had other plans that were far from grand.
A huge storm came and tore up his raft,
And Odysseus had to swim to shore, his strength was sapped.

But thank goodness, he made it to your coast,
And from there, his journey he would boast.
So let's give it up for this ancient lad,
'Cuz his adventures were wild, they make us glad.

Yo, listen up let me tell you a tale,
Of a sailor who went through an epic fail,
He tried to land but there were rocks by the bay,
And the waves threw him back into the sea, no way!

But this sailor was a fighter, he didn't give up,
He swam on and on until he found a river to plug,
A perfect landing spot, no rocks in sight,
He got out of the water with all his might.

He was tired and hurt, but he found some leaves,
And made himself a bed, oh what a relief!
He slept till the next day, all the way till noon,
When he woke up to a beautiful sight, he swooned!

The daughter of the king was there, looking fair,
Like a goddess on the beach with her maidens, aware
Of the sailor in need, they rushed to his aid,
They gave him food and drink, and clothes, unafraid.

Now, let me tell you, this girl was so kind,
More than we'd expect from someone her age, you'll find,
She helped him out, when he was in dire straits,
And he lived to tell the tale of their fate.

That's the story of the sailor so brave,
Who swam and slept and lived to see another day,
And the girl who helped him, a true queen,
Like a boss, like a legend, a true MVP, you feelin'?

Yo Alcinous, don't be furious,
I'm just glad that you're curious,
About why your daughter, ain't no scam,
Didn't bring me along from the tram.

But let me just say, with no bluff,
Your daughter's kindness was enough,
She showed me the way to your door,
And now I'm here, begging for more.

Your hospitality is really top notch,
And I appreciate it a lot,
But let me just tell you with no flack,
I'm here on a mission, that's a fact.

So let's sit down and have a chat,
About why you're the coolest cat,
And how we can change the world with your sway,
In a totally lit and dope way.

And in case you're wondering why I'm so fly,
It's because I'm living my best life,
And with that being said, let's get rolling,
On the most epic adventure that's worth telling.

Oh dang, don't throw shade at her,
Ulysses didn't follow, he was a lil' scared
He thought you'd be mad 'bout seeing him there
Everyone gets grumpy, it's not that rare. 
#justsaying #sorrynotsorry #suspish

Hold up, Alcinous, you're so chill,  
I'm feeling your vibes, I swear I will.  
Marry your daughter? That's quite the plot,  
But I've got a wife, man, forget me not.  

Your offer's lit, I can't deny,  
An estate and house? That's fly.  
But I can't stay, don't you know,  
I've got a long journey to go.  

Your sailors and ships do sound sick,  
Rhyming with Yellow-haired Rhadamanthus, a cool trick.  
And Euboea, furthest of all the lands,  
But I gotta decline, man, please understand.  

Thanks though, for your hospitality,  
You're one cool dude, that's our reality.  
I'll take my leave, on my own way,  
But I know we'll meet another day.

Oh snap, Ulysses kicked back and prayed it up
"Yo, Jove, make Alcinous stay true to his pup
If he does, he'll get fame that ain't never gonna stop,
And then I can finally bounce and return to my crop."

The maids were like "yo, let's set the bed"
With "good red rugs" to rest Ulysses' head
They spread coverlets and woollen cloaks too
For our boy Ulysses who was feeling blue

Then the maids grabbed torches, so bright and gleaming
Urging Ulysses to sleep, without any scheming
"Come with us, sir stranger, your bed is all set"
And our guy was excited, he couldn't forget

So he went to his bed, feeling really glad
The maids, they did good, no one was feeling bad
Here ends the story of Ulysses' rest
Now it's time to sleep, we wish you the best!

Check it, y'all, Ulysses in a bed,  
A room with echo, right above the gateway, it's said.  
But Alcinous, he's laid up in the inner lair,  
With the queen, his wife, beside him without a care.  

It's lit, Ulysses resting up in a cozy place,  
While the sounds beneath him add to the space.  
And Alcinous, he's chillin' in the main part,  
With his lady, feelin' fine in his heart.  

It's all good in this palace, that's for sure,  
Ulysses and Alcinous ain't messin' with the poor.  
But hey, props to them for living it up,  
While the rest of us deal with life and all its stuff.  

So let's raise a glass, and give a toast,  
To these two kings and their royal coast.  
They may live in luxury and dine on the freshest dish,  
But we all know that life is more than just this.

Hey there, let me tell you a tale,
A story that'll make you wail.
It's about a wicked party last night,
I swear, it was totally outta sight.

The vibes were lit, the music bumpin',
The energy in the air, truly something.
There were peeps from all over the place,
Swapping deets and showing their face.

The drinks were flowing, the people glowing,
And the DJ had the speakers loudly blowing.
I was vibin' and groovin' all over the floor,
I couldn't help but scream "Yass queen, encore!"

The party kept raging till the break of dawn,
And we didn't stop until our energy was gone.
My phone was full of snaps, oh geez,
And the memories will forever please.

I gotta say, it was epic and sick,
A party I'd never forget that was so quick.
I can't wait for the next one, oh yes,
When we'll do it again and put it to the test!

BOOK VIII

As the sun rose up with its golden light,
Ulysses and Alcinous sat in sight.
They sat on a bench made of polished stone,
While Minerva went around like one of Alcinous' own.

She went up to the folks, one by one,
Calling the council to have some fun.
"Listen up, y'all, this stranger's got a story,
Been to hell and back, it's gonna be gory."

"Phaeacians, come and hear him out,
He's a god among men, no doubt."
With her words, they all stepped up,
Excited to hear this stranger's stuff.

Memes he didn't have, but tales he had plenty,
Of the rough seas and battles aplenty.
So listen up folks, don't miss a beat,
He's got stories that are hard to beat.

Yo, listen up, let me tell you 'bout Ulysses
A man so lit, his skills never cease
The Phaecians were impressed, they couldn't believe
How tall and stately he appeared to be 

Minerva did her thing, the goddess of beauty
Gave Ulysses a glow, so everyone could see
They all wanted to come, they flocked to the hall
From seats to standing room, it was packed wall-to-wall 

Alcinous, the king, took the lead, started to speak
About the trials of skill, challenges they would seek
Ulysses was ready, he was gonna bring the heat
And show them all why he was elite. 

Meme references, internet slang, it's all good to go
When telling the tale of Ulysses, a hero we all know.

"Ok listen, y'all," he began with a grin,
"This stranger needs escort, let's let him in.
He came from East or West, we don't know,
But we can help him and let him go.
We'll get our ship, it hasn't sailed before,
With 52 young sailors to explore.
We'll make a feast when they're out at sea,
Party at my house, it's lit, trust me.
Young guys, listen up, y'all are the team,
Row your oars, and fulfill this dream.
As for y'all elders, you'll be with me,
Entertaining our guest, you'll see.
Demodocus will sing, it's about time,
His songs are fire, they're so on prime."

Aye, the crew set sail with vigor and might,
Fifty-two oarsmen ready to take flight.
They drew the ship to the waters so blue,
With twisted leather ties, their oars they drew.

They spread the sails, so white and so bright,
The wind caught them and took them in flight.
On shore they went to Alcinous’ abode,
Where the feast was to be served with a load.

The precincts filled with men, all in a row,
Old and young, not a one was slow.
Alcinous killed many beasts for the meal,
A feast so grand, it would make your heart feel.

Demodocus was fetched to the hall,
His tunes and songs would enliven all.
The banquet was lit, that much is true,
And the guests were all stoked for what would ensue.

Yo, check it out, a famous bard! 
Demodocus, songbird, ain't it hard? 
The muse loved him, gave him voice divine,
But snatched his sight, that's not so fine.

Pontonous led him to his seat,
Set him upright, gave him a treat.
Hung his lyre, showed him where to feel,
A basket of food, and wine to keel.

Now the bard can make us all swoon,
With his melodies, come hear them soon!
He may not see, but he sure can croon,
Thanks to the muse and her gift boon. 

*insert "he's blind but he can still play a mean guitar" meme*

As the feast began, everyone indulged to eat and drink,
But then Demodocus grabbed the mic and made us all start to think,
He sung the songs of the heroes and the clash between two greats,
Ulysses and Achilles, whose words were like a game of high stakes.

Agamemnon grinned ear to ear when the quarrel began,
For Apollo had warned him with a fortune-telling plan,
In the end, these fierce words were the foundation of a war so grim,
Between Danaans and Trojans, causing everything to become quite dim. 

It's like when two squad members start a battle of their own,
Over something petty, but neither one wants to be alone,
And that's when things get crazy and start to escalate,
Leading to a mess, just like the Trojan War's fate.

As the bard strummed his strummer,
Ulysses couldn't help but be a bummer,
He pulled his mantle over his face,
Didn't want the Phaeacians to see his disgrace.

After wiping the tears from his eyes,
Ulysses made a drink-offering to the skies,
But when the Phaeacians wanted to hear more,
Ulysses' sadness overflowed to the floor.

No one noticed, except for Alcinous,
Who heard Ulysses' blubbering with focus,
He said, "Let's move on to sports right away,
To show off our skills that we display."

The Phaeacians agreed to the proposition,
Excited to show off their athletic ambition,
Boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners too,
They wanted to impress their guest with full view.
