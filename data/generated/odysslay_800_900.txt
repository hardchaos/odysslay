Yo mom, don't be vexed with me, 
I know you expected more from me, 
But these peeps be driving me insane, 
I can't always keep myself tame. 

Those suitors really got me riled,
And their ways are anything but mild,
But this fight with Irus was a loss,
The stranger left him brain-tossed. 

I wish the gods would strike them down, 
Each and every suitor clown,
Make them soft like Irus lying there,
With no strength left to go anywhere.

Yo, Eurymachus, stop spitting game,
Penelope ain't just another dame.
She's the queen of this house, the boss,
And your flattery ain't gonna make her toss.

You think you're smooth with your words,
But Penelope sees straight through your herds.
She's got brains and beauty, a deadly combo,
And she's not here for your cheesy flow.

If you want to impress this queen,
You gotta show her something she's never seen.
Stop with the compliments and the chatter,
And maybe then she'll consider the matter.

So step back, Eurymachus, don't be a hater,
Penelope's got more on her plate than a suitor player.
She's a queen, a mother, and a wife,
And she deserves more than a life of strife.

"Yo, Penelope, your story's deep,
It's clear your heart is full of grief.
I feel you girl, it's tough to be
In a world where men don't respect me.

Your husband's gone to fight the Trojans,
He knew it was dangerous and awesome.
He warned you of the trials ahead,
But he knew you'll thrive, even when he's dead.

It's true, these suitors are out of line,
Trying to court you, but not bringing a dime,
They come to your house and eat your food,
But won't give you gifts or make you feel good.

But Penelope, you'll stand your ground,
Don't let these suitors push you around,
Keep showing strength and staying true,
Your husband's love will guide you through."

Yo, Ulysses was listenin' to Penelope,
Spittin' mad game, tryna get some dough.
Flattery left and right, but he knew the truth,
She was playin' the suitors, no love to pursue.

Ulysses was smart, he knew what was up,
Penelope's game was weak, her words were corrupt.
He watched from the shadows, with a sly grin,
Ready to take back what was rightfully his within.

These suitors weren't loyal, they just wanted to feast,
But Ulysses had a plan, a trick up his sleeve.
He'd show 'em who's boss, he'd take back his home,
And Penelope, his queen, would never have to be alone.

So he listened to her words, with a cool demeanor,
Knowing that soon, he'd be the ultimate winner.
Penelope may have fooled the suitors for a bit,
But Ulysses was the king, and he wasn't takin' any sh#t.

Antinous is right, you can't decline,
gifts are here, just take them, it's fine,
but we won't leave, it's not the deal,
till Penelope weds, the best man for real.

Don't be shy, choose what you like,
It's a chance, don't take a hike,
But hear us clear, we're all contenders,
To woo this queen, with love and splendors.

So take your time, don't feel rushed,
The best man wins, crowned and brushed,
We'll wait for you, till you decide,
But remember this, we won't hide.

We want to win, fair and square,
To be the one, with love and care,
So pick your presents, without strain,
But choose your groom, it's all in vain.

And hey girl, don't you worry,
We're all up to date, not like in a hurry,
We'll show you love, like never before,
And give you all, that and more.

Yo, Antinous spit a bar,
And all the others went far,
Sending their servants for gifts,
To give the goddess a lift.

Antinous came back with a dress of gold,
So exquisite, it had to be sold.
Eurymachus with a chain so bright,
It gleamed like the sun in its might.

Eurydamas's earrings were the talk of the night,
Three pendants sparkling with all their might.
Pisander gifted a necklace so rare,
It put all other gifts to despair.

Everyone else gave gifts so swell,
All to worship the goddess well.
And with that, the feast came to a close,
Everyone happy and full, with hearts in repose.

"Y'all suitors need to chill, don't you see?
The queen needs some space, just let her be.
She's got gifts to receive, and duties to do,
And y'all out here, singing like it's high school.
But I gotta say, your moves are kinda dope,
It's like watching TikToks, I almost lost hope.
Anyway, let's light up these braziers so bright,
And let the queen receive her gifts in the light.
And maids, I see y'all holding those torches like pros,
You're the real MVPs, that's how it goes."

Yo, maids of Ulysses, listen up quick,
Head inside and give the queen a kick,
Do some spinning, pick that wool,
And amuse her to banish any lull.

I'll hold the light, no need to worry,
Stay till morning, no need to hurry,
But don't try to beat me, I can stand the test,
Like a meme, I always come out best.

Yo, these maids are savage, laughing away
While pretty Melantho starts to play
Gibing at him, contemptuously at that
Doesn't she know it's not where it's at?

Daughter of Dolius, but Penelope raised
With toys and love, yet she's so unfazed
No care for her mistress, who's filled with sorrow
Misconducting with Eurymachus, like there's no tomorrow

Hold up, sis, why you gotta hate on my boy?
Talking trash 'bout him like he's just a useless toy?
Irus had it coming, he deserved the beat-down,
And my boy Odysseus wore that victory crown. 

But why you gotta talk like you're so above?
Can't you see this man's just spreading the love?
Maybe instead of judging like you're all high and mighty,
You could show some kindness and be a little bit more mighty.

And don't go acting like you're all that and a bag of chips,
With your fancy clothes and your wine on your lips.
We all know that you ain't too cool for school,
So don't act like you're too good to rule.

So cut the hate and the drama, it's time to move on,
And don't go thinking that you're the only one.
My boy Odysseus may be a poor wretch to you,
But to us he's a hero, through and through.

Oh snap, Ulysses ain't playing,
He's ready to start slaying.
This vixen's got some nerve,
But Ulysses won't observe.

He's about to spill the tea,
And make everyone see,
The lies that she's been spreading,
His anger is not forgetting.

Telemachus won't take this lightly,
Ulysses won't let her do this slightly.
She'll be torn apart like an emoji,
This is not a game, it's no Yoshi.

Ulysses is a hero, he's fierce and true,
This vixen doesn't stand a chance, boo.

Ulysses, our man, he stood tall,  
Near braziers burning, he had a ball.  
The women, they were shook,  
Thought they were in for a crook.  

But our hero held torches high,  
And looked intensely into the sky.  
He was pondering events to come,  
Waiting for them to strike and some.  

Ulysses was wise, he knew,  
That fate would unravel and come through.  
The women, they didn't have a clue,  
But he was ready, there was nothing new.  

Like a boss, he owned that space,  
Stood with poise, had a steady pace.  
Ulysses was definitely the man,  
No one could touch him, understand?

Y'all hear that trash talk, 
Eurymachus just made Ulysses the laughingstock. 
But Minerva ain't having any of that mess, 
She wants Ulysses to feel their disrespect, as she does confess. 

Eurymachus, son of Polybus, of course, 
Mocks Ulysses' baldness without remorse. 
But let me tell you something, it's clear as day, 
This man ain't just come here for no play. 

His mind is sharp, his cunning undeniable, 
He's got Penelope's heart, his love is un-untouchable. 
So don't be fooled by his lack of hair, 
This man is mighty, with nothing to despair. 

Minerva is on his side, that's a fact, 
So step off, you suitors, you're all wack. 
And don't forget, Ulysses is a beast, 
So run along now, before he unleashes his feast. 

Bet you didn't think I knew about this myth, 
But your girl here is well-read, and quite the whiz. 
So don't underestimate me, or Ulysses' plight, 
Or I might have to come after you with all my might.

Yo, listen up, stranger, the king does ask,
Will you work for pay, or is labor a task?
Stone fence, tree planting, all in his reel,
He'll provide your attire and a daily meal.

But Ulysses replied, "Nah, king, not me,
Don't want to work, gotta stay fly and free.
Beggin' on the streets, yeah that's my style,
Feelin' good with my belly full, mile by mile."

But the king was mad, didn't wanna hear,
Ulysses' words, thought they were insincere.
"You're just lazy, got bad ways," he spat,
"No job for you, get out of my chat."

Ay yo Eurymachus, it's time for some action, come let's give it a try, no need for distraction. Bring out the scythe, let's mow from dawn till dusk, and show who's the real boss, without any fuss. Or if you're all about that farming life, let's each take some tawny oxen, and plough with all our might. We'll see who can drive that straight furrow, and won't even have to borrow, any help or trick from the internet's echo. 

Now if it's war you want, then war you'll get, give me a shield, some spears, and the helmet that fits, and I'll lead the pack, with no turning back. Your insults and cruelty come from a place of insecurity, cause you're living your life in a world of obscurity. But when Ulysses comes back home, the doors are wide and free, but for you they'll be narrow, you'll struggle to flee, from the wrath of the king, who'll show you the meaning of being.

Eurymachus was raging, no telling what he'd do.
He accused Ulysses; said his words were untrue.
"Just because you defeated Irus in a fight,
Doesn't mean you can speak how you please tonight."
He grabbed a footstool with anger in his eyes,
But Ulysses hid behind Amphinomus, wise.
The stool hit the cupbearer, he fell to the ground,
The suitors were angry, chaos all around.
They wished the stranger would simply disappear,
Frowned amongst themselves, wishing the end was near.
"Why disturb us like this over a tramp?" they said,
"If he keeps it up, we'll have to give him the boot," was the dread.

Yo, what's good my homies, why ya actin' crazy?
Chill with the food and drinks, don't be so hazy.
I swear an evil spirit must be lurkin',
Let's all hit the sack before we start jerkin'. 

Telemachus, my dude, I feel you on this,
These old heads need to learn some bliss.
No need to argue or cause a big fight,
Just head home and sleep tight. 

I don't wanna be rude or cause any hate,
But your behavior right now is really not great.
So grab your stuff and say goodbye to the rest,
Go home and chillax, that's what's best.

The suitors thought he was extra,
His bold speech, they couldn't measure.
But Amphinomus, he was clever,
Said let's make no fuss, whatsoever.
No violence should come to play,
Let the drinks continue, go on your way.
As for the stranger, he's in T's house,
Let him deal with it, no need to rouse.

Yo, he spoke and it was rad,
His peeps were pleased and feeling glad,
Mulius mixed a drink with care,
Water and wine to share and bear.

Each man sipped from the bowl,
Their offerings to the gods, a goal,
They drank and drank, all merry,
And took their leave, not to tarry.

To each his own humble abode,
The way each man is surely showed,
Their paths they took, home straight,
Slept in their beds, dreaming fate.

I got you fam, don't be stressed,
I'll hype your story, no request denied or suppressed.

This is the tea we all crave,
Spill it out, don't be afraid.

Your story's fire, let's make it trend,
And blow up like a VSCO influencer friend.

You got the scoop, the deeds are sick,
I can't wait to share this to my clique.

We stan a good piece of drama,
Like Kim K and Kanye, that's a Bad Karma.

This story's so lit, it's like a meme,
Makes my heart race like a caffeine.

Like a TikTok, it's going viral,
And leaving us shook, it's so viral.

So let's get that clout and let it rain,
This story's hype, it's not quite monotone, but it's slayin'!

BOOK XIX

Yo, Ulysses was so shook,
He needed to find a way to get his weapons and armor to cook,
Telemachus listened while thinking 'bout the scheme,
And they both agreed to take it down, if you know what I mean.

He told Telemachus they had to be discreet,
Crafting an excuse that's not too neat,
Just say the armor was getting dirty,
And moving it down would avoid the flirty.

Telemachus, you gotta make it extra clear,
That with so much wine and time, things might turn queer,
They might fight and even do some harm,
And nobody wants that kind of charm.

If the suitors start to ask,
Telemachus, just give them a little task,
Tell them they're worrying about the soot,
And you're just trying to keep it cute.

With the help of Minerva, they'll get through,
And the suitors won't even have a clue,
Ulysses will be able to strike,
And make them feel the wrath of his spike.

Oh snap, Telemachus is on a mission.
He ain't playin', gotta handle the tradition.
He called up Euryclea, the nurse with the power,
Told her to corral the ladies and close the tower.

Telemachus wants that armor in pristine condition,
No smirches or soot, just a perfect rendition.
It's been neglected, no one cares for it now,
He'll stash it away safely in the store room, no how.

The maidens will stay put, can't be causing a scene,
While Telemachus handles things, he's got the lean mean gene.
His father would be proud, he's carrying on the legacy,
With Euryclea by his side, things'll be done easily.

Telemachus is the future, he's got it all deep,
So while he works on the armor, his fame will surely seep.

Aight, Euryclea, I hear you speakin'
But let me tell you, my plans ain't weakenin'
I'm ready to take charge of this house
And be the boss that everyone can arouse

But wait, who's gonna light up my path?
To the store room, I need someone to do the math
The maids wanna help, but they can't come along
Sorry, ladies, but this task is too strong

I need someone who's down to ride
And won't let anything get in their stride
So if you know a homie who's always lit
Tell them to come through, and we'll make a hit

As for the maids, they can take a seat
'Cause I am the one who's bringing the heat
Let's light up the way and get to the store
And show these goods what we're looking for

Yo, Telemachus is not one to play
If you wanna eat his bread, you better not just stay
He needs a light, a stranger must show
Earn your keep, from your head down to your toe
No matter where you're from, you gotta work for your plate
That's the rule, no debate 
Like they say in memes, "you gotta earn your keep"
Or it's goodbye to the bread, and no time to sleep

Oh my, Telemachus, what a sight!
These walls are shining oh so bright!
It's not just fire, oh no, my friend,
A god is here, that's what we can comprehend!

Minerva's here! Check out her golden light,
Bringing the shine, making things bright!
Father, let's get the gear inside,
Before we continue with our awesome stride.

Helmets, shields, and spears, oh my,
We'll get them all, I won't deny.
Minerva, please guide us through,
Your light is lit, we trust in you!

"Whoa, stop the drama, no need for vex,
Chill out and go get some rest,
Let me talk to the ladies, 
And don't you worry about the maybes.
Your mama will be asking questions, 
But I'll answer them all without objections."

Hey yo, Telemachus went to bed 
While Ulysses pondered, scheming in his head 
He wanted those suitors dead, oh so bad 
And with Minerva's help, he wouldn't be sad

Ulysses knew what had to be done
He couldn't let those suitors have any fun
He had to kill them, one by one 
And make sure they knew he had won

With Minerva's power, he could succeed
And show those suitors they couldn't proceed 
Ulysses was ready, he had a plan 
It was time to take a stand

So watch out suitors, Ulysses is coming 
And he's not here for any sweet nothings 
He's here to take back what is his 
And leave you all in utter dis    may.

Yo Penelope strutted down, looking like a queen,
A seat for her was set, it was truly pristine.
Icmalius made it, with silver and ivory,
A fleece covered it, so her seat was cozy.

Her seat by the fire, where she always sat,
The maids joined her, to gossip and chat.
They cleared the tables, where the suitors were savage,
And took cups and bread, making a cleanup damage.

The braziers were emptied, full of embers bright,
Wood was thrown upon them, to give warmth and light.
But Melantho spoke up, feeling quite bold,
"Get out, stranger, or we'll leave you out in the cold."

Ulysses stood his ground, he didn't flinch,
Yo Melantho, you need to give up that inch.
He was calm but firm, he wouldn't leave so easily,
Ulysses wasn't going to back down measly.

Hold up, this woman's getting heated,
But Ulysses, he ain't defeated,
He used to live the high life, you see,
But now he begs on bended knee.

Don't be acting like you're above,
'Cause you could end up like him, love,
Jove took everything, left him with rags,
And now he's just another tramp who begs.

So, beware, pride comes before a fall,
You might lose it all, and that's not all,
Ulysses could come back, don't you know?
And his son, Telemachus, ain't no fool to show.

So, don't mess around with the maids in the house,
Or they'll get in trouble with Telemachus, the mouse,
And even though Ulysses might be gone,
His legacy still shines on. #StayHumble #TelemachusRocks #UlyssesWho

Oh snap, Penelope came in hot,
Is that a maid, or a thot?
Talking back like she's got the power,
But she's 'bout to meet Penelope's tower.

"I see your behavior is abominable,
Better watch out or you'll be quite audible,"
Said Penelope, getting all riled up,
While the maid tries to back out of her mess-up.

Penelope's husband is gone, it's true,
And she's feeling sad, just like me and you,
But she's not taking disrespect from a maid,
She's got too much pride, too much shade.

So listen, y'all, and heed Penelope's words,
Or else you'll be like that maid, like a bunch of nerds.
No need to act rude, just show some respect,
Or you'll be getting a talking-to, let me reflect.

Oh my days, did you hear that?

Queen Penelope wants to chat

She needs a seat with a fleece

So the visitor can feel at ease

Eurynome was tasked with the job

To bring the seat and not to sob

The stranger had a story to tell

And Penelope wanted to listen well

Yo, Penelope, you're lookin' fly
Asking questions, wonderin' why
Who I be and where I'm from
Let me tell you, it won't take long

I'm a stranger, that's for sure
But my story, it's quite pure
My town is one you may not know
But it's where I was raised and where I grow

My parents, they were kind and true
Raised me right, taught me what to do
But now I'm here, so far from home
Just a wanderer, all alone

But enough about me, Penelope dear
Let's talk about you, so don't you fear
How you've waited for years on end
For your man, your heart, and your best friend

Yo, Ulysses spitting straight fire,
Madam, there's nobody higher.
With fame that reaches the stars,
You're like a king without the cars.

You uphold righteousness like a boss,
Your people do good deeds, no loss.
The earth yields grain and fruit so rare,
Your reign is oh-so-fair.

But listen, I'm here in your crib,
Don't ask about my race, don't rib.
My memories hurt, my heart's sad,
Can't sit here crying, it's just bad.

One of your servants might catch me,
Eyes filled with tears, brewing like tea.
Thinking I'm drunk, can't hold my liquor,
But really, it's just my emotions that flicker.

Aye, Penelope, I hear your plight
Your suitors give you so much fright
You're skilled in needlework, that's great
But these guys, they just won't wait

Your heart is heavy, we understand
The pressure from your parents is out of hand
Your son is noble, that's for sure
But it's time to find a husband, you can't ignore

But hold up, wait a minute, who am I?
I'm your cool assistant, here to supply
Some hype and cheer, some modern flair
To your tales of woe, Penelope, dear

Tell me, where you from, what's your story
Are you a queen, or is that allegory?
Father and mother, you certainly had
But I bet they weren't as lit as, say, Drake's dad

So spill the tea, let's hear the scoop
We're here for you, let us be the group
To lift you up, and keep you strong
Through all the hardships, all the wrongs.

Yo, listen up, madam, this is Aethon speakin',
I'll answer your questions, even if it's grievin'.
As an exile, I've wandered far and wide,
Suffering among peoples, feeling all the vibes.

There's an isle called Crete, it's fresh and fair,
With nine cities and people speakin' everywhere.
Achaeans, Eteocretans, Dorians too,
And Pelasgi nobles, all coexistin' in view.

In the great town of Cnossus, Minos reigned supreme,
Sippin' tea with Jove every nine years like a dream.
Deucalion was his son, who had two children in his stead,
Idomeneus and myself, Aethon, the name by which I'm led.

My bro set sail for Troy, brave and bold,
While I stayed in Crete, hospitable and told,
Of the time when winds took Ulysses off course,
Leavin' him stranded in Amnisus without recourse.

I helped him out by showin' him hospitality,
Feedin' him and his crew with abundant vitality.
They stayed with me for twelve days without haste,
Givin' thanks for oxen, wine, and barley meal at a feast.

The North wind blew strong makin' it hard to stand,
Perhaps some unfriendly god had it planned.
But on the thirteenth day, the wind finally ceased,
And Ulysses and his men were finally released.

Yo welcome, Penelope, to the modern age,
I'll hype up your story like your hubby on the center stage.
Ulysses, that man was wicked clever,
His tales, they'll make your heart break forever.

As he spoke, your tears fell like rivers overflowing,
Melting your cheeks like snow, yo it was mind-blowing.
But Ulysses held his gaze, his eyes as hard as iron,
With tears he restrained, his strength left you admiring.

Now to put him to the test, you do desire,
To see if his tales are just a liar.
Describe to you the look of your man,
And his companions, let's see if he can.

Penelope, Ulysses knows your man well,
Yo, he was dressed like a hero, no need to dwell.
Brave and strong, with a fierce look in his eye,
His companions are legends, no need to lie.

So, Penelope, hope this hypes up your story,
Your man is a king, yo, he's got all the glory.

Oh snap, you ask about Ulysses,
It's been twenty years, tryna remember gives me stress.
But listen up, I'll try my best,
To describe his outfit and put your mind at rest.

His mantle was purple, double lined real neat,
Fastened with a gold brooch, made his outfit complete.
The brooch showed a dog holding a fawn, 
Strangling it to death like some scene from a lawn.

And when it caught the sunlight, it shone so bright,
All the ladies were in awe at the sight.
His shirt was soft and hugged him tight, 
Fitted like the skin of an onion, that's just right. 

I don't know if he wore this gear on his departure,
Perhaps a friend gifted it for his adventure.
I gave him a sword of bronze, purple mantle all fine, 
Sent him off with respect for the man of his mind.

His servant Eurybates, was always by his side,
Hunched shoulders, dark skin, and curly hair so wide.
Ulysses treated him like a kin,
True friends till the end, they always win. 

So there you have it, my memory lane,
Ulysses outfit, I hope you're entertained.

Penelope, girl you got me in my feels
Ulysses gone, now your heart it reels
He brought you proof that he was your man
And you were moved by his master plan

You gave him clothes, a brooch so gold
His journey's end, so harsh and cold
You feel such pity for this poor stranger
And vow to welcome him like no other ranger

Oh fate be cruel, his journey bleak
The city he went to, you cannot even speak
But fear not, Penelope, this too shall pass
Your kindness shines bright, like a diamond glass.

Yo, madam, stop the tears and the cries,
I swear on my life, I'm not telling lies;
Ulysses, your husband, is still alive,
He's traveling home and on a path to thrive.

He's among the Thesprotians, getting treasures,
From one and another, with so much pleasure;
His men, though, brought their own demise,
And drowned on the way back, to everyone's surprise.

But Ulysses, oh Ulysses, a wily one he is,
He clung on to the keel and didn't miss,
The shores of Phaecia, where immortals roam,
Who treated him like a king, and made his journey their own.

Even if he'd come back earlier, he wouldn't stay,
He's a clever man, with a mind that plays,
He's gathering riches from lands far away,
And soon you'll see him here, without delay.

Now I swear on Jove, the first among gods,
And the hearth of Ulysses, who we all applaud,
That my words are true and will come to be,
Ulysses will return, you'll see, you'll see.

Penelope spoke with much grace and cheer,
but my heart sank as I drew near,
For I could see her doubt and fear.

"If Ulysses comes back," she said with hope,
"He'll gift you high and nope, nope, nope,
there ain't no one as great, don't be a dope."

I took in her words, but felt the strain
For Ulysses is gone, it's not the same,
Master's missing, what a great shame.

"Hey maids, help me out," I said,
"Give me a hand, I need my feet fed,
After that, I need a comfortable bed."

Her kindness moved me, I had to concede,
So I got washed up and sat down to feed,
And joy filled my heart that's long been in need.

Penelope's heart and wisdom is true,
She sits high above, that is her due,
Blessed is she - that's the truth, plain and blue.

Yo, Madam, I been roaming
Through rough sleeping places, never loafing
I don't need no blankets or rugs to cover
Been there, done that, that game is over

I've spent sleepless nights waiting for morning
With no soft bed, not even a cushion
I don't need any young hussies to touch my feet
But if there's an old woman with a story to beat

I'll let her wash them, I won't be fussy
As long as she's respectable, no young and sassy
I'm Ulysses, with a story to tell
Of my journey through hell, and how I broke the spell

So let me rest, and let me be
For my journey has been long, as you can see
Let my feet be washed by someone wise
And I'll continue my journey, under the skies

Yo Penelope, your words sound so acute,
Your guest's got some great manners, that's the truth.
In your crib, there's an elderly dame so kind,
Who nursed your hubby back when he was just a find.

Euryclea, that's the name of the old dame,
Who shall come and wash your guest's feet without any shame,
Even though she's weak, she'll take on this task,
For hospitality's a forte that she will not mask.

I bet you're thinking, his feet might totally smell,
Especially if this journey put him through hell,
But no worries my dear, you nailed it right,
Age slows us down and gives us quite the fight.

In short, your guest will be treated so well,
He'll leave your crib feeling ultra swell,
Now let's end this tale with a meme so dank,
"Livin' like Larry" is the phrase we'll bank.

Oh my dear, don't you cry,
I'll help you, just give me a try.
Your god-fearing heart's pure as gold,
But Jove's actions are just plain cold.

You gave him so many offerings and praise,
Yet he's trapped you in these unknown ways.
You prayed to see your son and grow old,
But now you're left here out in the cold.

Those foreign palace ladies must be so rude,
Gibing at you, that's just plain crude.
I get why you don't want their touch,
But I'll wash your feet, I love you so much.

Let me shout out something Penelope said,
You got me feeling compassion, that's no fib.
We've seen all kinds of people in distress,
But none like you, no, you're the best.

Your voice, your feet, your figure, too,
All match Ulysses' in every view.
Don't worry, old woman, dry those eyes,
Together we'll make a plan, no goodbyes.

Oh my squad, you won't believe,
What Ulysses said, it's like a heist, so thieve,
He said our likeness is on point, 
And I'm not going to lie, that's lit, no disappoint!
Everybody who's seen us together,
Says we look twin-like, is that whatevah?
I know what you're thinking, OMG,
But it's true, believe it hunny!

Okay, okay, let me tell you what went down,
Ulysses was chillin' by the fire, hangin' 'round,
His feet were in need of a good ol' wash,
So the old woman got a cauldron, it was quite posh.

She filled it with water, hot and cold,
And Ulysses got anxious, truth be told,
For he had a scar that gave him away,
And the old woman would notice without delay.

That scar was from the mighty boar,
Who attacked him once while he did explore,
With his grandpa Autolycus, what a guy,
The most skilled thief, willing to cheat and lie.

Mercury blessed Ulysses with this mark,
He'd burn animal bones in the dark,
And grant his buds a gift so rare,
To seek his company, they'd even dare.

Autolycus, Ulysses' grandpa so fly,
Went to Ithaca, and saw with his eye,
His daughter's newborn baby boy,
And said "Let's give him a name that brings joy."

After supper, the baby was placed,
On Autolycus' knees, he sat with grace,
And Euryclea said "Yo, you gotta name him now,
You've been wishin' for a grandkid, take a bow."

"Yo, Autolycus, that's quite a diss,
Naming your granddaughter 'Ulysses'
But no hate to your style, it's fly,
You're really on that name game high!

So when this kid goes on her trip,
She'll get a present, that's the tip
And she'll go home feeling so lit,
With a smile on her face that won't quit.

I'm sure that when she's grown,
She'll have a life that's fully blown
And maybe then she'll make her home,
On Mount Parnassus where she can roam.

Thanks for sharing your fam story,
It's filled with love and legacy, so smarty,
And now we'll always remember the glory,
Of this child named Ulysses, so hearty!"

Yo, Ulysses, my dude, went to Parnassus,
To get some gifts from Autolycus, no fuss.
His grandma, Amphithea, was full of affection,
Givin' him hugs and kisses with no objection.

Autolycus and his sons were more than delighted,
A five year old bull was brought in, fully sighted.
They flayed, cut up, and roasted it right,
So everyone could feast until night.

From sunrise to sunset, the food was lit,
All bellies were full, no one was throwin' a fit.
When the sun went down and it was dark outside,
They hit the hay, and enjoyed a peaceful vibe. 

Now that's the end of this ancient tale,
Maybe next time, they'll cook and feast with kale.

Dawn's child appeared with fingers all rosy,
Ulysses went hunting with hounds that were nosy.
On Parnassus' wooded slopes they did climb,
Soon reaching valleys that were breezy and fine.

The sun began to beat upon the fields,
Fresh-risen from Oceanus' slow still yields.
The boar heard their noise and came out to play,
Raising his bristles with fire in his gaze.

Ulysses raised his spear, oh so quick,
But the boar charged sideways, what a slick trick!
The brute ripped him above his strong knee,
A gash so deep, but not enough to reach the bone, you see.

Ulysses didn't give up, he hit that boar,
The spear was aimed perfectly, left the monster on the floor.
The brothers of Autolycus tended to Ulysses' deep cut,
Said a spell to stop the bleeding, then away they strut.

Autolycus and his sons showered with gifts galore,
They sent Ulysses on his journey home with much to adore.
Back in Ithaca, his parents were thrilled to see,
Their son's return with a story so lively.

They asked him all about it, how he got that scar,
Ulysses told them of his hunt, and that he had gone too far.

Oh my gosh, no way, are you for real?
Euryclea just recognized Ulysses, what a big deal!
She held his scarred limb and her eyes welled up with tears,
All of her joy and grief pouring out, it was clear. 

She dropped the foot and it hit the ground, 
The water all spilled, what a mess she found! 
Euryclea grabbed Ulysses' beard so tight,
She could hardly talk, what a crazy sight. 

"My dear child, I know it must be true,
You're Ulysses himself, I had no clue!
I had to touch and handle you to believe,
My mind is blown, I can hardly breathe!"

Yo, Ulysses at long last is back,
But Euryclea's giving him some flack
Instead of keeping her lips zipped tight,
She wants to shout it to the house with all her might.

But Ulysses ain't having none of that,
He grips her throat and pulls her flat
He tells her straight with no remorse,
If she tells anyone, he'll take no divorce.

She nursed him when he was just a lad,
But now her talk is making Ulysses mad
He's come to take back his rightful place,
And rid the house of each suitor's face.

So Euryclea, please hush it up,
Ulysses ain't playing, he's fed up
He's back to take what's his by right,
And send the suitors on their last good night.

"Yo, Euryclea, you're a queen, 
you keep it cool, you keep it clean.
No one can break you, no one can bend, 
Your strength is lit, it's on-trend.

When the suitors are delivered to your fate, 
you'll give a list we can appreciate.
Of women ill-behaved and those who are pure,
and we'll handle them, that's for sure.

Your tongue's like iron, it won't blab, 
and we'll handle the haters, like a viral dab." #savage #loyal #girlpower

Oh snap, Ulysses ain't having it with Nurse,
He knows how to form his own opinions, no curse.
He's telling her to hold her tongue,
And leave it up to heaven, it won't be long.

He's a boss, he's got this on lock,
He doesn't need any negativity to clock.
Ulysses is a king, a hero for days,
Oh, and don't forget that Nurse, he's got major sway.

He's got faith and trust in the powers above,
No need to worry, he's got it covered like a glove.
So let's all take a cue from the man Ulysses,
And leave our worries up to fate and its processes. 

But that doesn't mean we can't make it lit,
Like our favorite meme "it is what it is," a hit. 
So keep on slaying, keep being true,
And always remember, you do you!

"Yo, stranger, your story's got me hooked,
But tell me now, have you ever looked
Upon my husband, brave and true?
Tell me, have you met him too?"

Ulysses replied with cunning grace,
"Your hubby and I, we spent some days
In Troy, where we fought and bled,
And Homer wrote about what we did."

Penelope's eyes grew wide with surprise,
"The fabled hero before my eyes?
Oh, how I long to see him again,
But alas, his fate remains a great pain."

Ulysses' heart was filled with glee,
As he knew his plan was about to be,
"Penelope, fear not, for he will return,
And then your heart will forever burn,
With love and joy, once again,
For the king of Ithaca, my friend."

And with that, he melted into the night,
Leaving Penelope with a glimmer of light,
Filled with hope and ecstasy,
Thanks to Ulysses, the man with strategy.

Yo stranger, let's talk real quick,
I'm strugglin' to sleep, it's making me sick.
My life's full of woe, it's like a curse,
I can't stop weeping, it's getting worse.

During the day I'm busy with work,
But even then, my heart is berserk.
At night it's even worse, I can't cope,
My heart is broken, it feels like rope.

My mind is like a nightingale's song,
A tragic tale, that's been too long.
Should I stay with my son, and be grand,
Or go with the suitors, who want my hand?

My son is begging me to go,
The suitors are causing us sorrow.
Then I had a dream, It's making me wonder,
And I'm hoping for your help to ponder.

Twenty geese, my most prized love
Were killed by an eagle from above,
He dug his beak into their necks,
And left them all, it was a wreck.

I cried and cried, until my maidens came,
And tried to comfort my heart full of pain.
But the eagle came back, this time with words,
Telling me this isn't over, but for the birds.

The geese are the suitors, he did say,
And he's really my husband in every way.
He's returning to fix things for me,
And put the suitors in their place, you'll see.

Oh, snap, Ulysses! 
You're spittin' fire so ruthless! 
Your dream interpretation is on fleek,
All the suitors will get wrecked, they're so weak!
They won't survive and they won't thrive,
Sorry not sorry, they didn't survive!
Your prophecy is so lit, Ulysses,
The suitors better run for their distresses!
It's like Drake said, "I'm upset,"
The suitors won't know what hit them yet!

Okay, so Penelope spun a tale
About dreams that could make you pale
There are two gates through which they come 
One selfish and one just for fun 

Ivory gates take you away
From reality, they make you sway
But the horns one, that's the real deal
A clear message it can reveal 

Penelope's dream, she can't be sure
If it's fake or it will be the cure 
A tournament of axes is the game
Suitors all want to win that fame 

Twelve axes waiting in a row 
Like a ship they stand, each an arrow's foe 
The suitor who can make the shot
Will win her hand, or so Penelope thought 

The dawn will bring a day so tough 
One that will cut her breath and rough 
From Ulysses' house she'll have to go
Her heart so heavy, her soul so low 

But hey, it's nothing but a dream 
Or maybe something that makes us scream
We'll have to wait and see what's true 
Until the dawn reveals the suitor who 

Can shoot that arrow straight and far 
And win Penelope's heart, Oh la la!

Okay, listen up queen, don't be mean,
Ulysses will come through, it's as if it's in his gene.
Don't defer the game, it won't be lame,
He'll beat the suitors at their own game.

You don't need to wait, Ulysses is great,
He'll string the bow, it's his noble trait.
He'll shoot those arrows, strong like a sparrow,
The iron won't stand a chance, it's time to throw.

So don't you worry, don't you fret,
Ulysses is coming, you can bet.
He'll take on the suitors, they'll regret,
Thinking they could beat him, but they met their sunset.

And if they try to mess around,
Ulysses will knock them to the ground.
He's the king, the boss, the man renowned,
With him around, victory is bound.

Yo girl, you gotta get some rest,
Even though I know you're quite oppressed,
By the thought of missing out on chat,
But Penelope, you can't do that.

You've gotta recharge for tomorrow,
So don't be consumed by your sorrow,
You can lay down on that couch and weep,
And maybe catch up on some sleep.

Ulysses, he's been gone a while,
But girl you got that Greek style,
You're strong, you're fierce, you're independent,
And your mind is sharp, it's never hesitant.

So go on, queen, give in to the night,
And dream of future battles you'll fight,
For when the morning sun does rise,
You'll be ready to conquer, you'll be wise.

And hey, when you wake up anew,
We'll chat some more, just me and you,
So don't worry, don't feel blue,
As long as there's wifi, we'll see it through.

#StayFierceQueen #SleepIsImportant #PenelopeTheGreekGoddess

She's feeling blue, in her room all alone,
With her maidens nearby, to them she's grown.
She laments her husband, dear and kind,
But Minerva steps in, sleep she'll find.

Sweet dreams ahead, her eyelids now close,
But will she remember any of those?
Or will she wake with a start in a while,
And feel her heart burst with tears and her smile?

Minerva's gift is a mercurial one,
Not always constant or easily done.
But tonight she's blessed, it seems to be,
So sleep well, dear Queen, sweet dreams, zzz. 😴

Yooo wassup, party people in the house?
Got a story for y'all, it's gonna make you shout!
It's got drama, it's got spice,
And it's definitely worth the price (which is free, by the way).

So, check it out, this girl, she's a real Queen B,
And she's always causing drama, like the reality TV.
She had beef with this dude, I think his name was Chad,
And things were getting heated, oh boy, it was bad.

They were throwing shade left and right,
Like a couple of catty mean girls in a fight,
But then, out of nowhere, came a plot twist,
And suddenly, their feud was dismissed.

Turns out, they had been dating all along,
Like, whoa, that's some crazy love song.
They went from enemies to lovers, like a modern-day Romeo and Juliet,
And all of us were like, "OMG, we didn't expect that!"

So, moral of the story, don't judge a book by its cover,
You never know what's hidden under the lover.
And always keep an open mind and heart,
Like the internet says, "let's vibe and never fall apart!"

BOOK XX

Yo, Ulysses was chillin' on a cowhide,
Thinkin' bout how to take the suitors for a ride,
He covered himself with sheepskins, warm and snuggly,
And Eurynome threw a cloak, making him extra comfy.

But then, the ladies who had been messin' around,
Came out the house all giggly with sounds,
This made Ulysses seriously livid,
Thinking 'bout killin' all of them, he was wicked.

His heart growled like a mama dog with pups,
Showin' his teeth like a boss, he didn't give up,
But he calmed himself, beat his chest like a king,
Remembered when the Cyclops ate his friends like a swing.

"Stay cool, heart, you've been through worse," he said,
Recallin' how he used his cunning and led,
His crew out of the Cyclops' lair,
Ulysses knew, he had to be wise and fair.

Yo homie, why you staying up so late? 
In your own crib, with your family safe and great 
I see you tossing and turning, thinking of how to slay 
Those wicked suitors, so they won’t come and play 

But hold up, my dude, don’t forget who you are 
A warrior so strong, like a shooting star 
And plus, you got a goddess on your side 
Minerva’s here to help you turn the tide 

She’s chillin’ up there in disguise 
Watching over you with her all-knowing eyes 
So don’t you fret, don’t you worry, don’t you fear 
With her guidance, victory will soon be near 

Head to bed now, get some rest 
Sleep well, my bro, you’re truly blessed 
Wake up tomorrow, with a fresh new start 
And let the goddess guide you with her mighty heart

Aye, Odysseus, I hear your plight,
trying to take out the suitors, a rough fight.
The numbers are high, it's no surprise,
but with our help you'll cut them down to size.

Don't worry, man, we've got your back,
your enemies will fall, that's a fact.
But after the dust settles and the fight's done,
you're concerned about where to run.

Haters gonna hate, they'll be out for blood,
you gotta have a plan to escape their cud.
We'll figure it out, don't have a doubt,
just trust in us, we'll help you sprout.

So let's get to work and make a scheme,
together we'll make the suitors scream.
G-Unit out! (I had to throw that in,)
let's make sure these guys don't win.

Oh my goddess, Minerva, you're like a rich tea,
Protecting old mates like in ancient history.
You're like a superhero, but no Wonder Woman,
And if there's danger lurking, you're the one to summon.

Listen, mortals can be dumb, I'm speaking out,
But Minerva's wise, you gotta give a shout-out,
She's always got your back, through thick and thin,
So trust her, friend, and you're sure to win.

Let's say there's 50 bands, with some real big guns,
Don't fear, Minerva's got us covered, no need to run.
We'll take their sheep and cattle, and make it rain,
And by sunrise, we'll be far from any pain.

But now it's time to hit the hay,
You don't wanna toss and turn, it's just not OK.
So catch some Z's, and you'll be fine,
Thanks to Minerva, your goddess divine.

She bounced back to Olympus with a snap,
And left him there, snoozin', taking a nap.
But before she left, she cast a spell,
A deep slumber on this mortal fella.

Her voice flowed like a river, oh so divine,
And he drifted off, as if watching vines.
But now he dreams, in a world all his own,
With the gods and heroes, all widely known.

Even though he's just a mere mortal guy,
He'll explore the universe, sparkin' joy.
Thanks to the goddess from above,
He'll slumber soundly, enveloped in love.

Just like the meme that's oh so great,
Sleepy time tea will seal his fate.
And when he wakes, he'll feel brand new,
Ready to tackle whatever life throws, out of the blue.

Oh man, Ulysses was in a slumber so deep,
His wife woke up and started to weep.
She prayed to Diana, asked for relief,
Wished for an arrow to cause her grief.

She wanted to disappear from mortal sight,
And be hidden from everyone's light.
Just like the daughters of Pandareus,
Who were taken away, away from all of us.

Venus took care of them, taught them well,
So they could thrive, and not simply dwell.
Juno bestowed upon them beauty and grace,
While Minerva gave them plenty of ace.

But Venus was gone when the winds took them far,
And made them into servants of Erinyes, who mar.
She just wished to disappear,
Away from everything, away from the fear.

She couldn't close her eyes, couldn't sleep,
Her misery followed, misery that's deep.
She had a dream that Ulysses was there,
But woke up to emptiness, it didn't seem fair.

Ulysses heard her cry the weep,
he couldn't help but wonder as he did sleep
the voice sounded so familiar, it was hard to keep

He got up from his resting pile,
took the cloak and led with a smile,
in the courtyard, he kept it in style.

He went outside to make a prayer,
to Father Jove, that he might hear,
he asked for another sign to steer.

He wanted to hear the voice of another,
someone else who lived with his mother,
and guide him back to his home like a brother.

Ulysses listens to the wind and the sound,
unleashed his inner self is something he found,
to hope a sign would get him homeward bound.

Yo, Ulysses prayed up high,
And Jove heard him with a thunderous reply,
Up on Olympus, the heavens did roar,
Ulysses knew that it meant something more.

Inside the mill, a woman did shout,
Giving a sign, Ulysses had no doubt,
Twelve women to grind wheat and barley,
This one left, the rest in the barley.

Weak and tired, she cried out to Jove,
"End their feasts, let this be the last grove,"
Father Jove, king of earth and sky,
Please end their dinners, don't let them get by.

These suitors have used me up,
With their constant mealtime erupts,
Please, Jove, let this be the last,
So I can grind in peace, without past.

Ulysses knew that now was his time,
To take back what was rightfully mine,
Jove had heard his cry, and so did she,
The miller-woman who just wanted to be free.

With Jove on his side, Ulysses can rest,
Knowing the end of their feast is the best,
No more grinding, just peace in his home,
Until his final victory is fully grown.

Oh my gosh, Ulysses is the man,
He's finally coming up with a plan.
He heard the omens, he got a clue,
And now he knows what he's gotta do.

The thunder boomed loud and clear,
And Ulysses knew he had nothing to fear.
The woman's speech gave him a beat,
And now it's time to take a seat.

The suitors think they've got it all,
But Ulysses is about to make them fall.
They all think they're gonna win,
But Ulysses is about to give them a spin.

He's got a trick up his sleeve,
And the suitors won't even believe,
What's about to go down,
They're about to look like a bunch of clowns.

Ulysses is gonna take back control,
And the suitors won't have any role.
He's got his confidence and his might,
And he's gonna put up a fight.

So watch out suitors, Ulysses is here,
And he's not gonna disappear.
He's got his eyes on the prize,
And he won't compromise.

As the fire blazed bright and the maids awoke, Telemachus dressed up- no joke.
He strapped his sword and put on his kicks, 
also readying a spear with deadly pricks.
Telemachus walked out, talking to Euryclea, "Did you show hospitality to the stranger, or leave him alone to be a lone ranger?
My mom's kinda funny, she treats some folks so special, but ignores the ones who are truly beneficial."

"Yo, don't pass the blame on the stranger," said Euryclea with no anger. "He sat and drank his wine with no distraction, your mom offered him more bread without any hesitation. He declined, no need for negotiation. When he wanted to sleep, she offered the best, but he declined with a solid protest. He preferred a bullock hide and sheepskins, giving him comfort so divine. A cloak I threw to make sure he'll be fine."

As Telemachus walked, his two dogs by his side
Euryclea called the maids, their duties to abide
"Sprinkle the water, sweep the cloisters with care
Cover the seats and tables, do it with flair!
Get the cups and jugs, and make them gleam bright
Fill them with water, quick, with all your might!
The suitors will arrive, it's a feast day, oh my
They'll be here early like a bird in the sky!"

As the women went for water, 
The men began chores like they oughta'. 
Firewood was chopped and pigs set free, 
But Ulysses was wondering, just like me. 

The swineherd asked with a grin, 
If they were still acting like they would win. 
"Are they being mean or treating you well?" 
He asked Ulysses, hoping he could tell. 

The suitors had been quite rude, 
But now they were starting to include 
The stranger in their daily routine, 
Though they still thought they could be king and queen. 

Ulysses watched as they chopped and carried, 
Thinking of how they could soon be buried. 
But for now, he played the role of a guest, 
Waiting for the perfect moment to be the best. 

As the swineherd went to tend the pigs, 
Ulysses knew that he had to dig. 
Deeper into their plans he must go, 
To ensure their ultimate overthrow.

Yo, Ulysses, you savage and wise,
I feel you, dawg, with those guys.
They deal so wicked, high and proud,
Without a sense of shame screaming loud.

Their lack of manners is straight-up bogus,
Creeping through houses like some janky Smokey Bear hocus pocus.
May heaven send them their wrath,
And give them what's coming on their path.

As Melanthius came through,
Bringing goats with his crew,
He saw Ulysses and said "Hey,
What are you still doing here anyway?
Begging without any shame,
Can't you go somewhere else to play this game?
Why don't we settle this score,
And give each other a taste of our fists, and more?
Plenty of feasts with the Achaeans around,
Why stick here and keep getting turned down?"

Philoetius pulled up real slow
Asked the Swineherd 'bout the new bro
"Where's he from? Is he a king?
This man looks like he's seen some things"
The Swineherd shook his head, no reply
But Ulysses sat still, didn't deny
Philoetius, with his goats and cow,
Made sure they were safe, and took a vow
To find out who this stranger be
And if he's got a place in their family tree.

Yo, this dude walks up to Ulysses like "what's poppin', my guy?"
Saying he hopes he'll have better times, but that's a big lie
He calls out to Father Jove, the most malicious god, and why?
'Cause he's feeling down and thinks Ulysses is living a lie
He's in rags just like this man, and that brings a tear to his eye
He says Ulysses might be dead or in the house of Hades, it's not a lie
He was his stockman, took care of his cattle, and they multiplied like pie
But now, they're getting eaten by others who don't even try
To show mercy to his son who's alive, and it's making him fly
Off the handle, he wants to flee with the cattle, and why?
It's too hard to stay and watch them get taken while he's living a lie
His situation is intolerable, but he's holding out for the guy
He believes Ulysses will return and make all the suitors say bye-bye.

"Oh dang, Ulysses, you speakin' the truth,
Swearing to the gods, no need for proof,
I can see you're legit, smart and all,
But you've got a challenge, I'll break the fourth wall.

You gotta take down the suitors, they're in your way,
But don't worry homie, you'll conquer, slay,
I bet ya'll thinkin', 'bout time to flex,
Ulysses will come back, and make them vex.

And like they say, 'It's on like Donkey Kong,'
Ulysses will take 'em down, all day long,
So keep your head up, don't stress or fret,
Ulysses will be back, you can bet your net."

Oh man, if Jove made it go down,
I'd be ready to help, no time to clown.
I'll go in hard, won't stop with the toil,
Like a legend, I'll work my soil.

No cap, I'll do my utmost best,
Won't take a break until there's no more quest.
I'm down for the cause, no room for quitting,
Got my head in the game, no room for sitting.

Like that Drake meme, I'll be there,
Helping out without any care.
You can count on me to do it right,
Even in the dark, I'll shine light.

So let's get it, no time for waiting,
The task at hand has me anticipating. 
I'll grind hard and bring success fast,
Just call on me and I'll be there, no questions asked.

Yo yo yo, Eumaeus was praying for a happy ending,
Hoping Ulysses would finally be back, no more pretending.
He hoped the gods would hear his prayer,
And bring Ulysses back in their care.

Eumaeus' heart was full of hope,
He knew Ulysses was tough as a rope.
He prayed to the gods with all his might,
Hoping Ulysses would return and make everything right.

Like a boss, he prayed with all his energy,
Hoping Ulysses would come back with his synergy.
He wanted his friend to finally come back,
And bring an end to his long, painful track. 

Eumaeus knew his friend was missed,
And he wanted him back, no more dismissed.
He prayed for his homecoming day,
And hoped that the gods would show him the way. 

So let's hype it up, let's get it hype,
Ulysses is coming back, that's not a type!
Eumaeus' prayers will be answered soon,
And we'll all be howling at the moon!

Oh snap, the suitors were up to no good
Plotting to murder Telemachus, which ain't cool in my 'hood
But then, from out of the blue
An eagle with a dove, flew into view 
And Amphinomus, in his wisdom, said 
"Let's chill and go eat instead, let's put murder to bed"

Oh my gosh, they went inside and spread out,
Laid their cloaks down, no need to pout.
They sacrificed the sheep, goats, and pigs,
And drank wine, dancing jigs.
Philoetius gave everyone a piece of bread,
While Melanthius poured wine to fill their heads.
They put their hands on the food divine,
What a feast, a meal so fine!

Hey yo, check it out, yo, Telemachus the man,
Making moves, putting Ulysses in the plan,
A shabby seat, but with wine in a gold cup,
Sipping with class, while the suitors act up.

This ain't no public house, this belongs to Ulysses,
Telemachus taking charge, miss him with the nonsense,
He's got the meats, the wine, and the power,
Suitors better back off, before things turn sour.

No gibes or blows in this homey abode,
Telemachus knows how to lighten the load,
So suitors, keep your hands and tongues in check,
Or else you'll find yourselves in quite the wreck. 

Telemachus is the man who's got the plan,
Keeping things cool with a drink in his hand,
Showing everyone who's boss in this place,
And the suitors better recognize, or they'll fall from grace.

Yo, Antinous, hold up, you're like a clown
Trying to shut down Telemachus, throwing shade all around
But he's not scared, he's speaking his mind
And you know it, that's why his boldness you can't unwind

Your squad's weak, not ready for a real fight
If Jove had let you, you still wouldn't have the might
To stop Telemachus, he's got courage for days
So listen up, you're just a bunch of disarrayed strays

Hold up, hold up, let me tell ya a story
'Bout some dudes and their quest for glory
Telemachus was the name of the son
Of Odysseus, the king who was gone

Antinous spoke, but Telemachus was chill
Just livin' life, not thinking it's a big deal
Heralds were bringing a holy hecatomb
Ain't no party like a Greek party, hot damn!

The Achaeans were gathered under Apollo's tree
Getting lit and vibin', just like you and me
No worries, just friends and some shady shade 
Chilling together until the sunlight fade.

Oh dang, they cooked up a feast so shiny,
Roasting meat to taste so tasty and fine-y.
Ulysses got the same portion as the rest,
Telemachus made sure, he was impressed.

The waiters listened to what the boss said,
They hooked Ulysses up, filled his plate, no shred.
In this banquet, they all had a seat,
And the food was lit, it couldn't be beat.

Just like a meme that's trending online,
This feast was epic, one of a kind.
Food that looked so good, it cannot be missed,
And Ulysses surely couldn't resist.

This meal was fire, and they ate with glee,
Their hearts so full, they couldn't disagree.
This feast was like the top TikTok trend,
It had everyone talking, until the very end.

Yo, let me tell you 'bout Ctesippus, oh what a clown,
He's makin' his way to Minerva with riches that astound.
Thinking he's the coolest in this hall,
He's makin' moves on Ulysses' wife, without any call. 

He's sayin' "Yo, check out this guest,
He's had his share, he's already blessed.
But, for the sake of hospitality,
I'm giving him a gift, for my nobility." 

Ctesippus thinks he can flirt and play,
As if it's all fair game and okay.
But Minerva's not fooled by his façade,
She wants Ulysses' wrath to be his squad. 

So Ctesippus, with his arrogance and pride,
Will soon regret the decisions he tried.
To court the queen and mock their guest,
He's messed with the wrong man, he'll soon be distressed.

This scene's got drama, it's straight out of a soap,
Telemachus is grown now, no longer a little dope.
Ctesippus, you better watch where you throw,
Or else he'll run you through with his spear, don't you know?

Ulysses dodges the heifer's foot with ease,
These guys need to learn some proper hospitality, please.
Telemachus is sick of the violence and shame,
One man against many, it's not much of a game.

Killing sheep and stealing wine is not cool,
Treating guests and women bad, that's just being a fool.
Telemachus has spoken, it's time to be kind,
And leave that uncivilized behavior behind.

Yo, what's good my homies? Let's chat,
Agelaus has the right idea, no need to get all that 
drama on the servant or the stranger,
peeps need to be kind and not put them in danger.

Telemachus and his mom, listen up, hear me out,
I get it, you've been waiting for him, no need to pout,
but let's be real, Ulysses ain't comin' back,
so it's time to move on, no need to keep track.

Talk to your mama, make a plan,
find a man who can be your number one fan,
let her marry the one with the sweetest deal,
so you can chill and eat a meal.

Get your inheritance in order, 
don't be a hoarder,
living your best life is what you need to do,
while your mama tends to another man's crew. 

Trust me guys, it'll all work out fine,
just stay grounded and always be kind,
let's end all this mess and strife,
and live a happy, drama-free life!

Oh dang, Agelaus, why you gotta be so mad,  
Telemachus ain't about to make his mama sad.  
While gifts are up for grabs and wedding bells can chime,  
it's up to Penelope to choose, it's her time to shine.  

Forced love, that's not the way to go,  
Telemachus knows and wants mama to know  
that he won't make her leave the grounds,  
no way would he lay those kinds of bounds.  

Whether Dad's gone or just all alone,  
Telemachus will do his part from home.  
So let's not fight and start a war,  
let's settle down and say no more.

Yo, the suitors were chatting through their feast,
But Minerva pulled up and disturbed their seat,
Made 'em laugh like hyenas, but it wasn't a treat,
Their meat got messed up and their tears dropped with defeat.

Theoclymenus took one look and exclaimed,
"What's got y'all down? This energy's deranged,
You're covered in darkness, cheeks stained,
With tears, walls drippin' blood, ghosts unrestrained.

The gloom's covering the sun, this scene's insane,
But don't worry, I got some insight to explain,
It's just Athena wreckin' y'all's brain,
Suitors put some respect on the queen of the game."

Oh snap, did Eurymachus just diss
Our dear stranger with his massive diss?
He called him crazy, said he's lost his mind
But we know that our stranger is one of a kind

Hey Eurymachus, do you even know
That you're about to face a major blow?
Our stranger is no ordinary guy,
He's got skills that'll make your heart fly high

Servants, don't listen to this hater
Let's show him just how our stranger is greater
He's been through it all, he's braved the night
And now you throw him out of sight?

Eurymachus, you should watch your back
Our stranger's no joke, no small hack
He may seem a little out of place
But he's got a heart with a steady pace

So don't mess with him, don't give him a diss
Or you'll find yourself in Major L's abyss
Now let's show our stranger some major love
'Cause he's a gift from the heavens above.

Hold up, did you hear what Theoclymenus said?
He don't need no one to escort him to bed.
He's got his own eyeballs, ears, and feet
He'll figure out what's going on, don't you retreat.

He can see the mischief in the air
The plotting and scheming, it's a dare.
These men are insulting and causing strife
But Theoclymenus will figure it out with his own life.

No need for a sidekick, he's got it handled
His understanding mind won't be dismantled.
So let's sit back and watch the show
Theoclymenus is about to steal the flow. 

PS: is it just me or does Theoclymenus sound like a troll face meme?

Listen, suitors, don't be so shady
Your ridicule is hella outdated and wavy
Telemachus is kind to offer hospitality
You can't handle his show of generosity, so hilarity
Insulting his guests, really? That's just low 
Especially when you got no game, like a zero 
Piraeus welcomes him with open arms 
While you guys continue your silly charms
Just because they don't fit your standard mold 
Doesn't mean they deserve to be sold 
Quit your clowning, stop pretending to be real 
Or you'll get roasted, like a cowardly heel.

Oh my gosh, Telemachus just sat there,
Watching his dad without a single care,
He knew his dad was about to attack,
And the suitors were in for a big smack.

But seriously, it's like he didn't even listen,
To the plan that his dad had been dishin',
He just sat there, expectant and still,
While Odysseus prepared for the kill.

Like, I get it, Odysseus is a warrior,
And he's about to make things a bit gorier,
But Telemachus should at least show support,
And maybe even offer up his own retort.

Either way, this drama is off the chain,
It's like a Greek tragedy without any strain,
And the suitors better watch out, they better be quick,
Or else they'll end up like that vine, "they did surgery on a grape" - just a statistic.

Goddamn, Penelope was chilling, listening to every word,
Sitting in her lavish seat, looking like a cultured bird.
The dinner was lit, sacrifices were made to the gods,
But the real feast was yet to come, and it was like nothing you've seen odds.

The goddess and the brave man were about to serve their fate,
And no one would be left unaffected, no one could debate.
It's like they brought this doom upon themselves, what were they thinking?
Now it was time for the consequences, the universe was unblinking.

Get ready for a wild ride, it's about to go down,
In ways that will leave you rattled, nothing to cover the frown.
Penelope was cool, calm, collected, and ready to see,
What fate had in store, it was bound to be one for history.

I'm hype as hell, can't wait to see what happens next,
Hold tight, baby, we're about to get wrecked.
No use fighting it, just let it happen, it's okay,
We're all doomed, but we can only hope we'll live on someday.

Hey hey, gather 'round and don't be shy
I've got a story that'll open your third eye
It's got the drama, the spice, and the tea
All the gossip you could ever dream to see

It starts with a girl, she's got it all
The Instagram likes and the perfect fall
But don't be fooled by her shining facade
Because underneath, she's feeling flawed

She meets a guy and thinks he's the one
Their romance is lit, like a midsummer sun
But then she finds out, he's got a secret
And it's something she never could expect it

He's a meme lord, with a talent so rare
His internet fame, she just can't compare
But the attention and the likes, they're just a facade
And deep down, he's feeling flawed

Together they learned, that life's not perfect
And sometimes it's not worth it
To hide behind screens and pretend to be
Someone we're not, in order to be seen

So let this be a lesson, for all you and me
We don't have to put on a show, just to be free
Embrace the real, embrace the you
Because being unique, is the coolest thing to do!
