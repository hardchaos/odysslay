Yo, while we were chillin', Circe, knew we done been to Hades' house, dressed up all fresh and came at us, quick as a mouse. Her servant girls were lit too, they brought us grub and wine, we knew we had hit the jackpot, no need to whine. She stood among us and said "y'all are mad bold, going down to Hades like that, it's like dying twice, I'm told. But no need to fret, stay here and feast, just take it slow. Head out tomorrow to continue your flow. I'll talk to Ulysses and make sure he's all good, so you don't end up lost in the woods."

Yo, we followed Circe's lead
Feasting hard, no time to plead
From sunrise to sunset, we stuffed our face
But when night fell, we found our sleeping space

Circe pulled me to the side
Asked about our crazy ride
Our adventures, she had to know
So we talked till the moon was aglow

We shared tales of monsters and gods
And all the craziness that we've fought
She listened intently, like a true friend
Our bond was strong, it wouldn't bend

But deep inside, I couldn't help but feel
That something was up, something was real
Was Circe trustworthy or just a fake?
A meme in my head, "I smell a snake"

'So lit, so rad,' replied I, 'Thanks for the heads up, my cool chad! With Sirens so sweet, my crew might die, But hey, I'll be fine, I'm willing to try. I won't let their song give me FOMO, my bros will wrap me up like a pharaoh. I'm lashed to the mast, feeling so snatched, Ready to vibe to their beats, totally unattached. If I yell to be free, ignore my plea, just crank up the tunes, let them wash over me.' With a sly wink, she gave a nod, 'Be careful, though... don't end up like a cod.'

Yo, listen up now, I got a story to tell,
About some sailors who almost fell,
To the Sirens' song, so sweet and beguiling,
That many a sailor's fate went spiraling.

Odysseus, he knew the danger ahead,
And so he warned everyone before they fled,
He told them about two paths they could take,
And how both of them could end in their wake.

On the one hand, there were rocks a' towerin',
So steep and high that even birds were cowerin',
But on the other hand, a dangerous song,
Could lure them to where they didn't belong.

The Wanderers, oh how they did rock,
Knocking ships over like a game of Jenga blocks,
None who had tried ever made it through,
'Til Argo, lucky enough to have a goddess or two.

Juno helped Argo avoid that sweet, sweet sound,
Saving Jason and his crew from falling to the ground,
Odysseus knew how to navigate through that mess,
And with his guidance, his men faced no distress.

So, my fellow gen-Z's and millennials alike,
If you hear a song that you can't help but strike,
Remember this story and be wise,
And say your goodbyes to the Siren's lies. #StaySafe #StayWoke #Mythology #Sirens #Odysseus #Argo #Juno #InternetCulture #StoryTelling #LitFam

Yo, listen up, this story's about rocks,
One so tall you'd think it reaches the docks.
It's peak lost in clouds, never clearly in sight,
Even in summer and fall, it's cloaked in a dark shroud of might.

No man could climb it, not even with twenty hands and feet,
It's as smooth as a baby's bottom, boy, now isn't that neat?
In the center, a cavern so high, you'd need a magic trick,
It faces West and to Erebus, but it's tricky, so take your ship quick.

Inside lies Scylla, a monster of great fright,
No god could face her without being struck with fright.
A hound-like voice, but her appearance will make you squirm,
With twelve feet and six necks, she's quite the monster worm.

At the end of each neck, a set of three rows of teeth,
One crunch and you're out, you won't need a wreath.
She sits in her cell, fishing for creatures to catch,
Dolphins, dogfish, even big monsters, she'll snatch.

Many ships have tried to pass her by,
But none have succeeded, they've all met their demise.
For she shoots out all her heads at once,
Pulling men into each mouth, oh what a bunch!

So sail with caution from here to there,
Or they'll hunt you down, beware, beware!

Yo fam, listen up close,
Let me tell you 'bout a story that's the most.
Odysseus on a ship, with his crew by his side,
Trying to sail past rocks and a whirlpool that'll make you hide.

These rocks are so close, like they're snuggled up tight,
And that fig tree is lush, a true sight to the light.
But beware of Charybdis, that whirling pool of doom,
It'll suck you in, make you go kaboom.

Three times a day, she spits water with rage,
And if you're too close, you'll be trapped in her cage.
Neptune ain't got nothing on this raging beast,
So hug Scylla tight, or you'll be deceased.

Losing six men is better than saying goodbye to your whole crew,
So drive as fast as you can, and hope you make it through.
Odysseus had to face it, and so do you,
With a little bit of luck, you'll make it past this dangerous brew.

As they say, it ain't easy being a sailor,
But when adventure calls, you gotta be a fierce trailer.
So hold on tight, and don't you dare stall,
Or you'll be the next one to take the fall. #Odysseus #Charybdis #Scylla #GreekMythology #SailorLyfe

Yo, captain, don't you fret
I got an idea that you won't regret
Avoiding Scylla? It'll be a breeze
Just listen up and follow my tease

So you know Charybdis, the god of the whirlpool
Avoiding that guy would be pretty cool
Why not take the long route around
So that Scylla's barks won't create a sound

To help you visualize, let's use a meme
A cat avoiding a cucumber, it's pretty serene
Just like that, you'll avoid Scylla, like a boss
And Charybdis will no longer be your loss

Woah, woah, woah, hold up there, my dude!
Did I just hear what I think I did?
You're brave, but do you have a clue,
Of the monster waiting for you, hid?

I'm talking Scylla, the queen of rough,
Ain't nothing mortal bout this woman, tough.
She's savage, rude, cruel and extreme,
She'll snatch your crew, just like a bad dream.

So you better be quick, and don'tcha stop,
Or you'll have Scylla's six heads on top
Of your sailors, and that ain't cool,
So drive your ship fast, you darn fool!

And when you pass, make sure you shout,
"At Crataiis, you old trout!"
Cause she's Scylla's mum, and she'll obey,
Stopping her daughter from catching her prey.

Yo, listen up to this story so strange,  
Of Odysseus, who had to range.  
He came across a land so bright,  
Where the sun-god’s herds grazed day and night. 

On Thrinacian island, the cattle were seven,  
With flocks of fifty, whose number did leaven.  
Phaethusa and Lampetie were their caretakers,  
The beautiful daughters of Hyperion, a light-maker. 

Their mother had sent them off to this isle afar,  
To watch their father’s flocks, without any car.  
Odysseus was warned to leave them be,  
Or else his men and ship would not flee. 

If he wished to return to his home sweet home,  
He had to resist the urge to roam.  
But if he dared harm the sun-god’s herds,  
His journey would be cursed with many a hurt.  

So, be warned, my dudes and dudettes,  
Don’t mess with the cattle or forgets.  
Or else you’ll face a terrible fate,  
And reach your homeland, but terribly late.

Yo listen up, this is a tale so bold
Of a captain with sweet swag and stories to be told
He sailed with his men and encountered a witch
But they were too slick to fall into her pitch

She spun her spells in the hope to ensnare
But our captain refused to succumb to despair
He rode the waves with his crew so mighty
Their determination to escape was downright flighty

The witch may have thought she had won
But our crew was blessed by the goddess of the sun
Circe granted them a wind so strong
And the crew sailed away with a victorious song

The ship flew across the sea with so much ease
As if it was surfing with a "hang loose" breeze
They fixed their ship with their cool gadgets
And headed out further for more unknown vastness

So if you ever need a story of adventure and might
About a captain who outsmarted magic with his own might
Then come listen to me, I'll tell you how he fought and won
And sailed away with his crew, shining brighter than the sun.

Yo, my peeps, my mind's all shook,
Gonna fill you in, let's take a look,
Got a prophecy from Circe I must share,
So we can face whatever's out there.

She said to steer clear of the Sirens' song,
It's tempting, but it'll only lead us wrong.
Still, I need to hear what they sing,
But no one else can, just our crew can bring.

So tie me up like a boss to the mast,
Make it tight, make it last,
I can't break free, that's the trick,
Even if my begging voice goes thick.

This is serious, it's not a joke,
We gotta stay together, we won't choke,
Through good and bad, life or death,
With eyes open, we'll take each breath. 

#SirenChallenge #CirceKnowsBest #StayTiedUpOrElse

Yo, let me tell you 'bout a tale so true,
Of a man named Odysseus and his crew,
They faced the island of the Sirens so fine,
But these beasts will mess with your mind.

The wind was calm, sea water still,
Men started rowing with all their skill,
Odysseus knew what had to be done,
Wax in ears, mast-bound, he's the only one.

The Sirens' singing, it's oh so sweet,
But sailors who hear it will meet defeat,
Odysseus, with his plan so bold,
Heard the song and his mind was sold.

But he stood strong, tied to the mast,
His crew protectors, out rowing fast,
'Til the island was behind their back,
And the Sirens' singing, nothing but a hack.

"Yo, Ulysses, don't be hesitant, 
Come and hear our song so resonant, 
Our voices enchanting, oh so sweet, 
It'll leave you charmed, no better treat. 

We know of Achaean's mighty fame, 
And all the gods' deeds so insane, 
The ills that plagued Trojans before they fell, 
And everything that's to come, oh well. 

So don't be shy and come along, 
Listen to us, your knowledge won't be wrong, 
Our song is going to make you wise, 
And leave you mesmerized, no surprise!" 

#Enchanting #MythologyMemes

Yo, my dudes, let me tell you 'bout a tale,
Of a man named Odysseus who set sail,
He heard sweet tunes that the Sirens sang,
But it wasn't long before he began to hang.

He signaled his crew with a little frown,
That he had to listen and couldn't be bound,
But they were smart and they didn't play,
They tied him up and sailed away.

As they moved on, they removed the wax,
And freed their captain from the binds and the hacks,
Odysseus was thrilled to hear those tunes,
But his crew was keen to leave those dunes.

And thus they journeyed on with their quest,
Encountering things that put them to the test,
But with their captain and crew so tried and true,
They always made it through and they made it anew.

Bruh, as soon as we passed the land,
I saw a huge wave rise like a boss, damn grand!
I could hear the roar of the sea 
The men were terrified and they let go of the oars with glee!
But yo, the ship stayed right in place
They stopped rowing at a fast pace
So I went around, to be real and kind
I encouraged every dude, 'don't lose your mind!'

Listen up, fam, we're in a bit of a jam
But don't forget about when the Cyclops was our big bad
With my brave ways, we're not quite in the same sad
Now let's row hard and muster up some mad
Trust in Jove and row with all we have
Coxswain, my dude, you gotta be our captain
Turn the ship away and don't let it happen
Hug that rock and we won't start cappin'
Or we'll be done for and our lives will be napkin

Oh my, Odysseus was quite the fighter
Ready to slay monsters, that couldn't be brighter
He listened to Circe, sure that was wise
But he broke one rule, which wasn't a surprise

"Put on your armor and grab a spear too
Tough times are coming, what will you do?"
With his men by his side, they braved the sea
Searching for Scylla, where could she be?

The men were nervous and he knew why
They didn't know what was lurking nigh
Odysseus stayed strong, ready for a fight
But Scylla was nowhere in his sight

He searched and strained, but no use
Until the monster appeared, ready to abuse
Odysseus and his men, what a sight to see
But he was ready, our hero, the Odyssey

Yo, we sailed into the Straits, fearing for our fate,
For on one side was Scylla, on the other, Charybdis' deadly trait.
The water bubbled and boiled like a cauldron so hot,
Spraying high on the rocks, screaming for us to stop.

As we watched the water spout and the whirlpool whirl,
Our minds became numb with terror, our hearts in a twirl.
Just as we thought it couldn't get any worse,
Scylla suddenly attacked with a devilish curse.

She snatched up my guys, the best men on board,
Their screams still echoing, their fate truly abhorred.
Like a fisherman spearing fish for a prize,
Scylla devoured my men before my very eyes.

It was the most sickening sight I'd seen in all my days,
This darkness before me, this never ending maze.
But I carried on, for I had to complete my quest,
Through all the obstacles, through everything that was best.

Yo, listen up, crew of mine,  
I got a prophecy, gonna drop some rhymes  
Teiresias warned me, I gotta be swift  
Stay away from Helios' island, and that's no myth  

The land of the sun god, sounds pretty fly  
But we're not welcome, and that's no lie  
I heard the cows mooing, the sheep bleating  
But we can't risk it, let's keep retreating  

Circe, she warned us, we gotta be smart  
Or Helios' wrath will tear us apart  
I know we're tired, I know we're spent  
But we gotta obey, this is not up for dissent  

So let's steer clear, let's not be fools  
Helios' island, ain't no place for us Jewels  
Our safety's top priority, that's the key  
Let's sail on, don't you agree?  

In meme-speak, I'll end this tale  
Stay woke, don't let the sun god impale  
Keep your head up, and your eyes peeled  
To the beach, let's not yield!

The crew was so tired they could hardly speak, 
Eurylochus, however, was acting like a freak. 
He said, "Ulysses, bro, you're being cruel,
You're strong as iron, and never tire, it's true. 

Your men, on the other hand, are worn out, 
They need to rest and get food, no doubt.
But you won't let them land and take a break,
Instead, you want them to sail and make a mistake. 

At night, the wind is strong and harmful too,
If we're unlucky, it'll wreck us too, 
Bro, let's have a meal here by the ship, 
Then tomorrow morning, we'll set sail with no slip."

Yo, all the guys agreed, Eurylochus spitting truth,
The gods out to get us, bringing mischief from the booth,
I know we outnumber you, but let's make a deal,
Don't mess with the livestock, let's chow down on the meal.

Heaven knows what danger we already face,
We don't need to anger the gods with our base,
Promise me you'll swear not to touch a single head,
Or we'll end up wishing we were already dead.

Circe's provided plenty so let's not get mad,
Trust me boys, it ain't worth making her dad,
If we all want to make it out of here alive,
Let's stick with what we have and strive.

Lit crew, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout a ship and a creature known as Scylla from hell.
Men swore an oath to keep their promise, no lie,
And they put their ship in a safe harbour nearby.

These sailors, they were tired and quite hungry too,
So they went to shore to cook a meal, that's what they'd do.
They ate and they drank, but then they started to speak,
Of comrades who were eaten by Scylla, so bleak.

The words were so sad, it made them all weep,
They cried so hard, they eventually fell asleep. 
This monster, it caused them such sad misery,
But now they rest, dreaming of victory.

Yo, it went down in the third watch of the night
The stars had shifted, everything was out of sight
Jove came through and brought a wild gale
The wind was so strong, it left no trail

Land and sea were covered with thick clouds
The darkness was too thick, it left no doubts
Out of the heavens, night sprang forth
It was like a scene from the North

But when Dawn, rosy-fingered, made an appearance
We found a cave, like a stroke of brilliance
Sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances there
We called the men together, ready to share

It was a council in a mystical place
The kind of vibes that can't be replaced
Just like the memes on the internet space
This story is now at a new pace.

I said to my squad, it's lit, we got food and drink in the ship, let's be legit and not touch the cattle on this trip. These cows and sheep belong to the almighty sun, who's always watching and listening to everyone. And they swore up and down, they would stick to the plan, Not trying to get left behind, stranded in this land.

Yo, for a month straight, the wind was whack
Only from the South and East, can you believe that?
The men stayed starvin', didn't touch the cows
Survivin' off hook and line, they weren't livin' like kings and queens, WOW
So, one day, I crept away from the bunch
Hoping the gods would show me a hunch
Found a spot, said my prayers, and lay my head to rest
Till I fell asleep and entered a sleepin' nest.

Yo, peeps, listen up to me,
We gotta act fast, can't you see?
There's nothun' worse than facing starvation,
So let's make an offering to avoid damnation.

Why not sacrifice the best of the cows,
To please the gods and take humble bows?
If we get back, we'll build a temple of high,
And make it grand with no limit to the sky.

But if Mister Sun wants to sink our ship,
And wants some revenge on this trippin' trip,
Then I rather drink salt water in despair,
Than starve in this island without any fare.

"Ay yo, y'all hear Eurylochus spittin' truth?
The boys agreed with him, no need to further proof.
Their cattle were chillin', no care in the world,
So they took the best and gave prayers to the gods unfurled.
No barley left, so they used oak-shoots instead,
Talkin' 'bout their feast, they gon' be well-fed.
They killed the cows and dressed their beef,
Wrapped the bones in fat, to be cooked by the reef.
No wine for drink-offerings, so they got crafty,
Kept pouring water, so their vibes wouldn't be ashy.
Grilled the meat, tasted it until it was gone,
Cut the rest up and put it on the spit, with a brawn." 

*mic drop* 🎤

Yo, woke up from my slumber, 
Smelled something that made me wonder, 
Hot roast meat, oh my gosh,
Prayed to the gods, feeling posh. 

"Immortal gods, how could you? 
Sending me to nap like a fool,
My loyal men are up to no good,
Off to the beach, they've misunderstood."

I marched towards the shore,
Saw my crew and I couldn't ignore,
The mess they made, oh dear,
My anger, they were about to bear.

But first, lemme take a selfie,
Post it to my Insta, feeling healthy,
Then it's time to lay down the law,
My crew better prepare for the raw.

Meanwhile, Lampetie didn't wait,
Hopped right up and flew to the sun, she's no bait,
Told him what we did to his cows with no hesitation,
And he went off, geez, what a situation!

The sun was boiling with anger and rage,
Said to the gods, "This time they've crossed the line, it's a new page,
Gotta get back at these Ulysses guys real quick,
Otherwise, I'll make sure they take a deathly dip."

He cried out to his peers up in the high,
"Father Jove, and all you other gods, hear my battle cry!
Ulysses' crew is about to face their worst fears,
Killing my cows, something that drives me to tears!"

He continued, "If they don't make this right,
I'm going down to Hades to shine my light,
Among the dead, they'll see my wrath,
Ulysses and his crew will feel my power, my path."

The sun was furious and filled with hate,
Ulysses needed to fix his mistake, the sun wouldn't wait,
He loved his cows with so much love and emotion,
Killing any more of them was definitely not an option.

Listen up, gods and all you fella-s, 
Jove's got a plan, a scheme so swella-s. 
He wants the sun to keep shining so bright,
But our poor seafarers are in for a fright.

With a bolt so white, lightning will strike,
Their ship will be shattered, what a dislike!
Jove's power on display will make them reel,
Into small pieces, their vessel he'll peel.

It's lit like a fire, a perfect plan,
Jove's got this in the palm of his hand.
Like that time when Drake was spittin' bars,
Jove is showing off his Godly stars.

Oh my gosh, let me tell you what's up,
Calypso spilled some tea, and it's super tough,
She said that Mercury's in the know,
And spilled some secrets that are worth the dough. 

I mean, can you even believe it,
Calypso heard it straight from the deity's lips, oh sh*t!
The gods are talking and we're not invited,
But thanks to Calypso, we're all feeling united. 

Mercury's the messenger, so he knows what's up,
And apparently, he's been dropping some pretty sick cuts,
Calypso's got the scoop and now we do too,
We're all in on the divine secrets crew. 

So let's take a sec to thank our girl Calypso,
For dropping some knowledge that's worth more than gold,
And now that we know what Mercury's been saying,
We'll be a step ahead and that's what I'm fraying!"

Yo, down by the shore of the sea
We saw some crazy signs and things to be
The cows were all dead, it was a massacre
I had to tell the crew, it was a disaster

I told them separately, but no one knew
What to do, we were in a huge moo moo
The Gods were surely not on our side
The hides of the cows crawled, we couldn't hide

The joints upon the spits began to low
Like cows, it was a really strange show
The meat kept making noises, raw or cooked
Like cows, it mooed, the whole crew was spooked

I don't know what's going on, can't deny
It's like a meme come to life, and it's no lie

Yo, listen up, hear my spiel
This story's wild, it's so real
Odysseus and his crew, they be chillin'
Grilling up cows, they do the grillin'

Jove was like, it's been six days
Time to stop with the beefy craze
They set sail, ready for the seas
But Zeus had other plans, oh please

A black cloud covered their ride
The sea turned dark, nowhere to hide
A squall hit hard from the West
Their mast snapped, it was a mess

The helmsman, he got hit so hard
His bones crushed, he fell overboard
No life left, a hero down
This adventure turned quite the frown. 

Bolt emojis to Zeus, he's the god
Who made this journey a little odd
Odysseus and his men, they must be brave
To survive this storm and this wild wave.

OMG, Jove's thunderbolts were wild,  
That ship was spinning like it was on a child's ride,  
Fire and brimstone, like my mixtape was lit,  
Lightning striking the ship, I can't get over it.  

The men fell into the sea like some seagulls,  
No chance of getting home, their situation was dreadful,  
Jove wasn't messing around, he had power like Thor,  
Those men had no hope, they couldn't ignore.

Yo, let me tell you a tale so epic,
About a sailor's adventure that's truly hectic.
He stuck with his ship despite the stormy weather,
Till the sea was too much and they lost it together.

The ship's keel drifted away from the hull,
Leaving him stranded and feeling quite dull.
The mast got knocked out into the abyss,
But wait, there's more, hear this.

A backstay of ox-thong was left hanging strong,
And with that, he lashed the mast like a pro all along.
Tied the keel and mast together for the ride,
And let the winds take him on the wildest ride.

It was like a scene straight out of a meme,
Floating away wherever the winds deemed.
But he took it all in like a boss,
And survived like a true sailor at loss.

Yo, the wind done changed, it's from the South again!
Which got me scared, I don't wanna be taken in
By Charybdis, that pool's a terrible scene!
And before I know it, I'm at Scylla's rock, getting keen.

The whirlpool's sucking water and I'm stuck in its hold,
But I cling tight like a bat to a fig tree, bold.
I can't plant my feet anywhere, my fate's been foretold,
But I hang on, patient, for the pool to unfold.

I wait so long, it's a drag like a court case in law,
But finally my raft escapes that whirlwind's jaw.
I fall heavily into the sea before it gets too raw,
And climb back onto my raft with a sigh of awe.

I grab the oars and begin to row with my hands,
But luckily Scylla didn't make any demands.
The gods saved me that day, without no reprimands,
And I live to tell this story to all my friends.

Yo yo my peeps, I gotta spill,
About how my life took a crazy thrill.
My journey was long, it took nine days,
Memes and slang came in handy in so many ways.

On the tenth night, the gods played their hand,
And hit me with a beach on this crazy land.
Ogygian Island was the name of this place,
Filled with gods and goddesses that I had to face.

But there was one, so powerful and strong,
Her name was Calypso, and she knew where I belonged.
She showed me kindness, and I gotta say,
It was better than any meme or internet display.

But listen, my friends, I've told this tale before,
And I don't wanna bore you or be a snore.
So let me end this in cool Gen-Z way,
Catch you on the flip side, have a lit day!

Hey there, my fam and squad, gather 'round
I've got a story that's sure to astound
It's got all the tea, it's spicy and hot
So buckle up tight, let's give it a shot

Once upon a time, in the digital space
There was a TikTok star with tons of grace
She danced and sang and made us all laugh
But then drama hit, and things got rough

Her ex-boyfriend, a gamer bro
Started a feud, just for show
He called her out, he spread some lies
But little did he know, she was wise

She clapped back, oh boy did she
She made a diss track, for all to see
And boy, it was fire, it was lit
She showed him up, and didn't quit

The internet cheered, they shouted and screamed
They shared her song, with all they deemed
Her fans went wild, they stan so hard
And as for the haters? They got barred

So now, this TikTok queen
Is living her best life, on the internet scene
She showed us courage, she showed us sass
And to that gamer bro? She said "bye, Felicia"  #micdrop #savage #queen

BOOK XIII

Hold up, did you hear what he said? 
His story has us all ahead. 
We're stuck in this cloister, 
On his words, fully engrossed-er. 

Alcinous began to speak, 
His voice so smooth and so sleek. 
We all sat there in silence, 
Eager to hear his tale with no violence. 

His story has us on the edge, 
We can't wait to see what's ahead. 
We're all just captivated, 
With every word that's narrated. 

The way he spins his tale is wild, 
It's like watching a meme go viral. 
We're on the edge of our seats, 
Anticipating each word he tweets. 

Alcinous, your story is lit, 
We're hanging on every bit. 
Keep it coming, don't stop now, 
Your audience is loving the wow!

Yo, Ulysses you made it through,
No more pain or misadventures for you.
Others, who come to my place to chill,
Listen up, I have a proposal to instill.

To you, who love to drink my finest wine,
And bask in the beauty of my bard that's divine,
Ulysses has already packed up his share,
But let's give him more to show that we care.

A large tripod and a cauldron for you, sir,
From each of us, this present we'll confer.
We'll split the cost and make it fair,
So everyone can show their love and care.

Yo, Alcinous, your hospitality's off the chain,
Thank you for the dinner, it was lit, no shame.
But now I'm eager to continue on my way,
I'm ready to leave at the break of day.

Your ship is dope, with everything safely stored,
It's chill that you wanna help me afford,
A trip home safe, you're a good dude,
And honorin' Jove, that's real gratitude.

But, I can't help but watch that sunset,
I gotta bounce, it's time to jet,
My legs are itching, my heart is too,
I gotta get going, it's what I gotta do. 

So, bless up, Alcinous, and your Phaecian crew,
I'll remember your kindness, forever true,
And if you ever find yourself in need,
Just tweet at me, I'll come with speed. #GoodVibesOnly

"Y'all, it's been real, peace out. Raise your cups up, send me off with a shout. My heart's desire fulfilled, got an escort and gifts. Hope I can use 'em well, no room for rifts. Pray my wife's chillin' with her squad, living in peace. And y'all back home, happy families increase. Blessings from above, good grace on your side. Keep negativity away, let love abide."

Alcinous and his squad all agreed,
That our hero should get what he needs.
A crew to take him on his trek,
So he could travel without a wreck.

The servant went and grabbed some booze,
So they could make a toast and choose,
To pray to Jove, the god on high,
And make sure our hero won't die.

They drank and prayed, then said goodbye,
And wished our hero clear blue skies.
With a nod and a wave, he set sail,
Thinking about his epic tale.

And as he rode the ocean waves,
He thought about the journey that he braved,
And he couldn't help but think it's true,
That this story is straight up lit like Pikachu!

Oh dang, Pontonous is slinging the wine,  
Pouring it up for everyone so fine.  
They all made an offering to the gods divine,  
Cheers to heaven, drinking that wine so fine.  

But Ulysses, he ain't done yet,  
He got a double cup, oh so lit.  
And hands it to the queen with much respect,  
She sips it back, no need to neglect.  

Arete's sipping that drink with ease,  
She knows what's up, she's queen of these.  
With Ulysses there, she's feeling that breeze,  
Sipping that drink just like it's a tease.  

So cheers to them, they know how to drink,  
Pouring them up, no need to think.  
They drink to the gods, they drink to their link,  
May they party forever, without even a blink.

Bye bye, queen, it's time to part ways,
Until old age comes and death pays,
I'll leave you now, so live in bliss,
In this house filled with kids and Alcinous.

Peace out, it's time for me to dip,
You've got your peeps and family to grip,
Stay happy in this cozy abode,
With kids and king to share the load.

I bid you adieu, my lady fair,
May your life always be full of flair,
Cherish your moments, every single one,
And keep on living, until your days are done.

As he be kickin' it, he crossed the threshold,
Alcinous sent a man to lead him to his ship and to the sea shore that's bold.
Arete also sent some maid servants with him,
One with a clean shirt and cloak, and another to carry his strong-box with some dim.
The third one brought corn and wine,
So he could have a good time and not whine.
When they got to the water side,
The crew took these things and put them on board with a sense of pride.
With all the meat and drink, they made sure it was tight,
So nothing would fall and cause a fright.
But for Ulysses, they laid a rug and a linen sheet,
So he could sleep well and not face defeat.
Then he too went on board and lay down without a word,
Whilst the crew took every man's place and loosed the hawser, like real nerds.
As they began rowing out to the sea,
Ulysses fell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike slumber in glee.

Yo, the ship was lit, making moves with no quit,
Riding waves fierce like a stallion's neck, so legit.
Ain't no falcon, no bird, no speed could keep track,
Of this vessel's pace, cutting through waves like a Mack.

Who's on board, you ask? A true hero in his time,
Cunning like the gods, surviving sea and battle's thine.
Now sleeping soundly, with a peace so deep,
Forgetting his struggles, finally laid to sleep. 

This ship, this hero, we stan them so much,
For they prove that resilience is always in touch.
We hype them up, give them the praise they deserve,
For they're the ones who inspire us to be tough.

So let's give a shoutout, a meme and a cheer,
For this ship, this hero, who we hold dear.
May they sail on, to more victories to their name,
And may their legacy forever remain. #LegendaryShip #SleepingHero #WaveRider

Yo, let me tell you 'bout a tale so dope,
Of a ship that sailed near a haven, no joke.
An old merman named Phorcys owned this crib,
Protected from wind and sea, what a clever bib.

The harbour was so bomb, not even moored,
A ship could stay there without feeling bored.
Standing tall was an olive tree,
Nearby, a cavern full of mystery.

Inside this spot, the nymphs got swag,
Mixing-bowls, wine-jars, and bees they had.
Great looms of stone created robes so neat,
Sea purple, it was a sight, hard to beat.

This cave had entrances two-fold,
Mortals could use one, but gods the other hold.
From the North and South, they could be found,
Through the latter entrance, gods were bound.

Yo, they brought the ship to shore,
Ulysses still asleep, snore by snore,
Lifted him up, laid him on sand,
Not a peep, he slept off that land.

Minerva helped him with some gifts,
Phaeacians were convinced to uplift,
Presents by the tree, hidden from the street,
Afterwards, they left with speedy feet.

No one could steal for Ulysses to take,
Once he opened his eyes, he'd be awake,
And then he'd have the best surprise,
Thanks to his friends, he'll be allies.

Yo daddy Jove, listen up please,
These mortals are making me weak in the knees,
The Phaeacians- my own blood, they boast,
But they disrespected me when Ulysses they brought as their host.

I promised to send him home, after enough pain,
Not to leave him stranded, or make his efforts in vain.
But now they've brought him home with gifts galore,
More than he'd have gotten in Troy, that's for sure.

If I let this slide, I'll lose my godly sway,
And my reputation will be washed away.
So what do we do to make things right?
Should we give them a fright, or spark a fight?

Oh my lord of the Earthquake, you speak of disrespect,
But the gods ain't that rude, they'd show you some respect.
It would be mad if deities dared to offend,
So don't you worry, they're loyal 'til the end.

But if it's mortals you're talking 'bout today,
And they're acting up in a disrespectful way,
Then it's all on you to figure out what to do,
Handle the situation, no need to feel blue.

You're the boss, you got this, don't need no cheerleading,
Just remember, you're mighty, there's no need for pleading.
So go forth and conquer, like a boss supreme,
Teach those mortals respect, make them dream your dream.

Yo, yo, yo, my dude is Neptune,
He's kinda salty, but trying to stay clean,
He don't wanna upset the king,
So he's hesitating, ain't doing a thing.

But hold up, hold up, he's got a plan,
To wreck that Phaecian ship, yo, that's the man,
He's saying it'll stop their escort game,
And bury their city under a mountain of fame.

That's a little extreme, you gotta admit,
But my guy Neptune, he just won't quit,
He's the god of the sea, he's got the power,
To lay waste to cities in less than an hour.

So let 'em know, Neptune's on the chase,
And if they come around, he'll wreck their place,
No escorts for them, no sir, no how,
Good luck Phaecians, y'all better bow.

"Yo, Zeus," replied I, "I'm down for your plan of surprise,
Turning that ship into a rock will be a dope disguise.
The city peeps will go wild, their reactions will be sicker,
And burying their town? That'll make them think you're the real bicker.

Let's do this like Nike, just do it and no need to wait,
We'll blow up Twitter feeds, we'll be the talk of the state.
They won't know what hit them, they'll be left shook and bamboozled,
Our plan will be so fire, they'll be left with opinions muzzled.

So let's get to it now, let's show them who's the boss,
We'll rock it like Ariana, showing them who's the sauce.
Our plan will be legendary, they'll be left with jaws on the floor,
We'll be the kings of the world, and they'll be left begging for more!"

Yo, Neptizzle came to play
When he heard the ship was on its way
He went to hang with the Phaecians
And waited for the ship with patience
When it arrived, he made a sly move
Turned it to stone, and made it groove
He pushed it down, oh so smooth
And then, he was off to groove!

Oh my days, did you see that ship?
It was as if it got stuck on a dip!
We looked away, just for a sec,
And it got rooted, what the heck?

I'm shook, fam, it's quite bizarre,
Who could've done it, near or far?
Our eyes were on it, every bit,
And now it's stuck, just like Brit.

Maybe Poseidon snatched it down,
And left it there for all around,
To see it rooted like a nail,
In the ground, or should I say, the sail.

But honestly, it's all a mystery,
This ship, it's stuck, can't you see?
Oh wait, I have a theory, my friends,
Perhaps it's magic, or some trend?

The Phaeacians were surely confused,
Their minds twisted and abused,
But one thing was certain, without a doubt,
Their ship's fate was sealed, no way out.

The Phaeacians were chill, always giving escorts with cheap thrills,
But Neptune wasn't lit, he had beef with their ships, and caused spills.
A curse on their city, buried under a high mountain,
But Alcinous had prophecy on his side, he was truly fountain.
No more escorts for them, no more trips with Phaeacians' aid,
And to Neptune they sacrificed twelve bulls so his wrath could fade.

Yo, the chiefs of the Phaecians were straight flexing,
Around King Neptune's altar with their offerings perplexing.
Then Ulysses woke up, back in his homeland,
But everything looked strange, like it was all planned.

Jove's daughter, Athena, made a foggy day,
So no one would know Ulysses was here to stay.
She wanted him to take revenge on the wicked suitors,
Without his wife or friends from recognizing his features.

The tracks, harbours, and trees all seemed strange,
As Ulysses started up and cried in despair, not quite in range.
He smote his thighs with the flat of his hands,
Worried about how his return would unfold amidst these new lands.

"Yo, this guy needs some savvy direction,
Is he with the savages or in civilized section?
He needs to stash his goods and plan his path
Or else some thief will definitely do the math.
He wishes to be with the Phaeacians in comfort,
Or with a nice chief who's not a grumpy wart.
The way his trip went was not even fair,
They didn't bring him home, like how dare.
May Jove the protector of suppliants hear his prayer,
And punish them for being so unaware.
Now he must check if his stuff is still there,
So no one can steal it, that's his biggest scare." 
#Savage #Blessed #Goals #Jupiter #Drama #FOMO #Lit #Hashtag.

Yo, Ulysses was straight trippin',
Counting coins and cauldrons, his heart skipping.
He had all the riches money could bring,
But still he longed for his own land's peaceful wing.

As he wandered by the sea in distress,
A young shepherd approached him with finesse.
Her cloak was fly, her feet in sandals so neat,
Ulysses' heart skipped a beat.

It was Minerva, the goddess so fly,
With a javelin in her hand that could touch the sky.
Ulysses was lit to see her in his presence,
They locked eyes, it was truly a blessing.

Oh, dude, I see you're lost and alone,
Don't worry, I'll help you find your way home,
Greetings and salutations, my dude,
I'll be your navigator, I'm in quite the good mood.

Protect your goods and keep you safe,
I'll do my best, there's no need to chafe,
You're asking 'bout the land and its folks,
And if it's an island or if it's on the coast.

Well, dude, you're in luck, 'cause I know,
I can show you the ropes and make your knowledge grow,
This country is dope, it's the land of the free,
With people of all kinds, from land to sea.

It's not just an island, no way, Jose,
It's connected to all, in a major way,
This place is cool, it's the best of the best,
So don't you worry, just sit back and rest.

Okay, listen up, stranger, you may seem kind of out of place
But let me fill you in, so you're not lost in space
This place is lit, and yeah, it's known both far and wide
Ithaca's where you're at, a place with a lot of pride

The land's pretty rocky, so driving's not that fun
But corn and wine? Boy, do we have a ton!
Rain and dew provide irrigation, water's not hard to find
Cattle and goats roam free, and all kinds of trees do bind

This place is the bomb dot com, water never runs dry
So it's no surprise, from Troy they'd know Ithaca on the fly
As Minerva said, this place is famous and grand
So, dear stranger, now just try to understand!

Yo, Ulysses just got home and he's feelin' fine,
But he spun a lie, and it wasn't benign,
Minerva called him out, she knew he was fakin',
Instinctive wiliness can be quite overtakin'.

He thought he was slick with his lying tale,
But Minerva knew his honesty was frail,
It's like that Drake meme, when he's saying "No,
But really he means "Yes", it's all just a show.

Ulysses tried to pull a fast one on us,
Thinking he could lie and we wouldn't fuss,
But we see right through him, no need to pretend,
Next time he'd better tell the truth, or it's the end.

Aye aye captain, you sound like a rapper,
Tell me your story homie, I won't be a napper.
You say you left Troy with lotsa' treasure,
But had to flee, it was quite a pressure.

You killed Orsilochus, the fastest runner,
And now you sprintin' like there's no other.
He accused you of not servin' his dad quite right,
So you killed him to make sure he wasn't right.

You sailed to escape, and asked Phoenicians for help,
To settle in Pylos or Elis, with your riches and wealth.
You gave them loot and they didn't mean any guile,
But the wind blew the ship, and it went off the Nile.

You landed in Ithaca, and were quite tired,
You lay down on the sand, a little uninspired.
The Phoenicians took your treasure and left you behind,
And now you're here, searching for something to find.

Dang, Minerva, you're looking fine,
Caressing Odysseus and being kind;
But let's talk real, this man's a beast,
Full of guile, cunning, a liar at least.

Odysseus, you sly dog, can't you drop your tricks?
Even though you've got a bunch of hicks?
But let's not dwell, we both can deceive,
You with your counsel, me with my subtlety, believe.

Of course, I'm Jove's daughter, the goddess Minerva,
With you through thick and thin, never an endeva'.
Remember how I helped the Phaeacians like you?
Now let me help hide your treasure, it's the least I could do.

But wait, there's more, troubles still to come,
In your own house, you gotta act like a mum,
Put up with everything, don't tell a soul,
Stay quiet, don't lose control.

Yo goddess, you always come through with the light,
But I can't keep up with all of your different sights.
Back in Troy, you were super kind to me,
But ever since then, you've been tough to see.

I'm lost and confused, can't tell where I'm at,
Feels like I'm stuck in some sort of trap.
Minerva, girl, tell me what's up,
Or am I just another one of your puppets?

I need to know the truth, don't play me like that,
My heart can't take it, don't you understand that?
Am I really home, in Ithaca once more,
Or is this some sort of twisted lore?

Yo, you always got something up in your dome,
But I won't leave you when you're feeling alone,
You're so slick with your words, a shifty boss,
I can't help but stick around, no matter the cost.

Most peeps would head straight home, family first,
But you don't seem to care, that's gotta hurt,
Your wife's at home, crying up a storm,
And you haven't asked about the fam since you were born.

I never worried 'bout you, thought you'd make it back okay,
Even though you lost your squad, Neptune had a price to pay,
But let me give you the tea, spill it all out clear,
This is the merman Phorcys' haven, olive tree right here.

The nymphs cave is nearby, let's not forget,
And you've been all over this mountain, no regrets,
So listen up, dude, I'm your trusty guide,
Let's do this together, side by side.

Oh snap, Ulysses back in his own turf,
After 20 years, he's finally off the surf.
He kissed the soil, feeling so blessed,
And prayed to nymphs like he was possessed.

"Yo, Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove,
I thought I won't see you again, but I hope
You'll grant me long life and happiness,
Plus, bring my son to manhood with finesse."

Ulysses sure knows how to show love,
He'll bring offerings, like a dove.
He hopes Athena, daughter of Zeus,
Will bless his journey and fill him with juice.

Yo, don't worry 'bout a thing,
We'll keep your stuff safe with this bling,
Let's stash it all up in the cave,
And ensure your valuables are saved.

Let's brainstorm how we can make it work,
Secure from thieves and any lurk,
Pack it tight like we're moving house,
We won't let your things go south.

Minerva's got this, fam, no doubt,
We'll keep your stuff from going out,
Our strategy will be top-notch,
No need to stress, we've got the watch.

So relax and take a seat,
Let us take care of this feat,
Your things will be in good hands,
Minerva's a queen with her plans.

Oh, bruh, let me tell you 'bout this king,
Ulysses, he's the dude who runs this thing.
He's got gold, bronze, and clothes so fresh,
The Phaecians gave 'em to him, oh yes!
But now he's hiding in a cave,
With Athena's help, he's gonna save
Himself and his kingdom, 'cause it's under attack,
By those suitors, yo, they gotta step back.

So they sat down by this giant tree,
Scheming how to make the suitors flee.
They'll come up with a plan so slick,
Like that meme where the cat plays with a stick.

Yo, Ulysses, listen up my man,
Those dudes in your house got a terrible plan,
They've been lording it up for years without you,
Your wife's been loyal, but they've been tryna woo.

She's been giving them hope and sending them love,
All the while thinking of you, like a dove,
They think they're slick, but they ain't got a clue,
Minerva's here to help, and she's got wisdom too.

Think of ways to lay hands on these fools,
And let them know you're no one's tool,
Strike swift and true like a deadly gun,
And make sure those suitors know they'll get none.

You got this, Ulysses, we all believe,
Now go and make those suitors grieve,
Remember, you're a hero, a legend of old,
Your story's about to get even more bold.

Oh, Ulysses, you sure have nerve,
Facing your struggles with a bit of verve,
Standing beside you, I'll help you out,
Like a boss lady, no room for doubt.

Your house may be full of strife and pain,
But with my advice, you'll surely gain,
Let's plot revenge, and crush the foe,
Together we'll make it a killer show.

Goddess at your side, you'll have the power,
To take on those who wronged you in their tower,
Think of the past, the Trojan War we won,
This battle will be over before it's begun.

Haters gonna hate, but we got each other's back,
No Zeus, no Poseidon, can make us slack,
We're the ultimate duo, like Batman and Robyn,
Bring on the challenge, 'cause we're just getting started.

No need to fear, for we're in this together,
With my help and courage, you'll fight like a feather,
So let's get this done, and show them who's the boss,
With our team work and brains, we'll toss them like moss.

Yo, listen up, this is dope, trust me, 
This plan will make those suitors flee. 
I'm gonna change your appearance, 
So that you're unrecognizable with coherence. 

We'll add mad wrinkles to your face, 
Your luscious locks will be out of place. 
A gross garment will be your attire, 
Guaranteed to make the suitors perspire. 

Your fine eyes will become blurry, 
Making you look like something out of a slurry. 
You'll be a sight for all to dread, 
Even to your wife, who you have wed. 

Go find the swineherd, he's a friend, 
With your beloved pigs, his time he'll spend. 
Check in on your kingdom and see, 
How the suitors are treating your property. 

As for me, I'm off to Sparta to check, 
On your son's life since you left the deck. 
When I come back we'll have a plan, 
To make the suitors scram. 

Stay low-key and keep it real, 
And soon those suitors will surely feel, 
The wrath and power of a true king, 
And the vengeance that he'll bring. 

*drops mic* #LitPlansForTheWin

Hold up, let me translate,
Ulysses asking why didn't you communicate?
You knew what was up, so why didn't you spill,
Did you want him to suffer, while you sit still?
Sailing through hardships, while others feast,
Not cool, man, not even in the least.

Oh my god, Minerva's spittin' truth,
Sending Telemachus on a journey, forsooth!
She wants him to get a good reputation,
And avoid any hurt or altercation.

He's kickin' it with Menelaus, quite chill,
With all provisions in hand, he doesn't feel ill.
But the suitors are fierce, and on his trail,
Hopin' he won't make it, so their plan won't fail.

Minerva's optimistic he'll be okay,
But those suitors should watch out, or they'll be gone away.
They're too busy eatin' up someone else's estate,
But they're in for a surprise, that's for damn sure, mate!

Oh snap, Minerva's really got that wand game!
She made him old, and wrinkled up his frame.
No more blonde locks, and his eyes went weak,
New clothes too, looking ragged and meek.

He used to look like a total hottie,
But now his appearance is pretty shoddy.
Minerva gave him a deer skin coat,
And a staff in case he gets stuck on a goat.

His wallet is rough, and full of holes,
But at least he's got something to hold.
No cash in sight, but he's still a boss,
Rockin' that grumpy-old-man vibe like a boss.

Oh snap, Telemachus is about to go on a ride,
With Athena by his side, he won't need to hide.
The goddess went straight to Lacedaemon, no lie,
To hype up Telemachus, like she's DJ Khaled saying "another one" before a new vibe.

Telemachus will soon learn 'bout his daddy's past,
With Athena as his guide, this adventure will last.
They'll fly through time like Marty and Doc,
Gonna need a flux capacitor to keep up with this flock.

But wait, who's that lurking in the shadows?
Is it a monster or just some foe in battle?
With Athena by his side, Telemachus will fight,
And defeat any enemy, with his epic might.

This story's lit, with drama and action,
Telemachus is gonna get the satisfaction,
Of finding out what his dad's been up to,
Thanks to Athena, the goddess with mad woo.

What's poppin' my homies, gather around!
I got a story that will leave you spellbound.
It's so lit, it'll make your head spin,
A tale to tell your squad, your kin.

Picture this: a wild adventure in the night,
A group of friends, full of delight.
They hop in a whip, ready to go,
Feeling themselves like a Kanye show.

They hit the town, cruising and vibing,
With Cardi B on, their swag was thriving.
They stop at a spot, lit like a candle,
Another level, it was pure scandal.

After a few drinks, they hit the dance floor,
Shimmy and shake, couldn't ask for more.
But little did they know, a plot was brewing,
The night took a turn, it was so confusing.

Suddenly the lights went out, complete darkness,
The music stopped too, it was heartless.
Then out of nowhere, a voice did appear,
"Solve this puzzle, or you'll shed a tear."

With only moments to think and react,
They knew they had to solve the task.
It was like the escape room, but way more intense,
Every second counted, not a moment to commence.

They worked together, phones out, typing fast,
Texting furiously, not a moment could they waste.
Solving each clue, one by one,
They were in it to win it, they couldn't come undone.

Finally, after what felt like hours,
They cracked the code, defeated the powers.
The lights came back on, cheers erupted,
They hugged and danced, their hearts interrupted.

So take a cue from this epic tale,
Gather your friends, set sail.
Explore the city, enjoy the ride,
And maybe, just maybe, you'll have a story to confide.

Now I gotta jet, catch you on the flip side,
Till then, peace out, stay fly, keep it live!

BOOK XIV

Ulysses took the rough road, quite a hike
To find the swineherd- his most thrifty tyke.
Minerva gave him the tip to seek 
The one who takes care of the pigs every week.

The swineherd sat in front of his place
Surrounded by yards and pigs with space.
He built it all himself without anyone knowing
With stones from the ground without even showing.

Thorn bushes fenced them from the rest of the land 
And all around, pigs had room to grandstand.
A strong oak fence was built with precision 
To keep the pigs safe without a single omission.

There were so many pigs it made Ulysses dizzy 
Instead of boars, suitors made them all a bit busy.
But, still, the swineherd had lots to give 
Always sending the best so the suitors would forgive.

Three-fifty boar pigs and four fierce hounds 
Making sure the pigs stay safe in their grounds.
Lastly, the swineherd was found cutting  
A pair of solid sandals, no ifs or butting.

Yo, when Ulysses approached the place
The barking hounds were in his face
But dude is smart, he sat right down
And let go of his wooden crown

The dogs were ready to cause some strife
But the swineherd saved him with his life
He threw some stones and made them flee
Then said, "old man, you're lucky to be

Alive and well, those dogs are mean
They could've ripped you, know what i mean?"
But he was in pain, for his master lost
Ulysses had to pay the cost

Now he's just a swineherd, serving pork
While his master is stranded with no fork
So come on in and have some bread
Tell me about you, where you fled

The swineherd said, "Bet, bro, you're too kind,
It's no problem, though, you're on my mind.
Take a seat on this bed of rushes and chill,
I got you a shaggy chamois skin, for real."
Ulysses then said, "I hope the gods bless
Your kindness and give you happiness.
Thank you for being so hospitable,
Your generosity is truly admirable."

Oh man, you speak truth, Eumaeus dude,
Strangers, beggars, they are all from Jove, no need to be rude.
Just take what you can get and be grateful, that's key,
'Cause young lords make servants live in fear, believe me.
You say your master would have done great things by ya,
But sadly, he's gone, and left you here to just survive, huh?
Helen's race seems to be pure evil,
Killing many a good man, they're certainly not peaceful.
So your master had to go fight the Trojans in Ilius town,
For kin Agamemnon, that's where glory was found.

A feast fit for the gods, that's what they had -
Roast pork and wine, quite a combo, mad!
The swineherd was kind, he picked the best,
Sacrificed the pigs, Ulysses was blessed.

Singed and spitted, the meat was so hot,
Barley meal seasoned, that hit the spot!
The swineherd, a boss, mixed up some wine,
Ivy-wood bowl, drinking time's divine.

"Dig in," he said to the hungry guest,
Ulysses was grateful, he felt so blessed.
The feast was lit, thanks to the swineherd guy,
A meal to remember, they both can't lie.

"Bro, grab a seat and munch on some pork,
The suitors take the best, like they're from New York.
But the gods don't dig this shameless behavior,
Respect is earned by those who do what's lawful and greater.

Even the fierce free-booters, they raid and they plunder,
But when they get home, they start to think and wonder.
They look for judgement, feeling conscience-stricken,
But these people, they waste Ulysses' estate; they be trippin'.

Some god must've told them that Ulysses is gone,
So they take what they want, like it's a marathon.
They don't make offers of marriage in the usual way,
They just take his wealth, like it's all just child's play.

Every day, they sacrifice a ton of wine,
They party hard, like it’s summertime.
Ulysses was rich, like twenty men combined,
The wealth he had, was just out of our mind.

He had twelve herds of cattle on the mainland,
And as many flocks of sheep, that led the band.
Twelve droves of pigs, and twelve wide-spreading herds of goats,
It's no wonder the suitors are hitting all the high notes.

Here in Ithaca, he had large flocks of goats,
And these suitors get his best like they're on remote.
As for me, I look after these pigs you see,
And send the best ones every day, like one, two, three."

Yo, Ulysses was straight up savage,
Eatin' and drinkin' like it was cabbage,
All while scheming for his ruthless desire,
His anger growing hotter than a fire.

The swineherd filled his cup with vino,
Ulysses was grateful, he didn't say no,
But curiosity sparked in his gaze,
As he asked about his owner, in a haze.

"Who was this dude, so rich and bold?
Whose life was taken, never to grow old?
Did I cross his path on my crazy trips?
I can't remember, my memory slips."

The gods may know, but Ulysses too,
Travelled far and wide, his story's true,
So he may have heard news of the master,
And with that, his revenge could come faster.

It's like that Drake meme, started from the bottom,
Now he's on a mission, can't nobody stop him,
Ulysses is destined for greatness,
His story will leave all others in shambles, for goodness sakes!

Yo, old man, your tale sounds fake,
I don't believe a single word you make,
Strangers come here with their lies,
Thinking they can fool us with their disguise.

My mistress Penelope has heard it all,
Every traveler who comes to our hall,
But they're all phonies with no real proof,
Just trying to score a meal and a roof.

And you, with your shirt and cloak so neat,
I bet you're just looking for something to eat,
You say Ulysses is lost at sea,
But I think that's just a fantasy.

Wolves and birds may have eaten his bones,
But his memory in my heart still hones,
I miss him dearly, he was more than a boss,
A loyal friend who never came across as a loss.

Yo listen up, let me tell you a tale
Of Ulysses, a legend who's not for sale
His friend was doubtful, didn't believe he'd return
But Ulysses swore by king Jove, he'd make the others burn

With his words so bold, he took an oath
By the hearth of his home, he'd bring forth his troth
No need to pay, he just wanted to wait
Till the man arrived, then he'd accept his fate

Ulysses was coming, that's what he said
Gonna rain down vengeance, on all those who'd misled
In this very year, he'd be back with his might
And all those who'd wronged him, would face a fight

So let's wait and watch, for the hero's return
And hope that he'll teach us, the things we all yearn
Of resilience and strength, in the toughest of times
This is the story that we'll tell for all times

Hey, Eumaeus, you old swineherd dude,
I ain't gonna lie, I'm in a bad mood.
Ulysses ain't comin' back, that's a fact,
So let's drop the subject, that's my tact.

I ain't dissin' your oath, that's for sure,
But hearin' 'bout Ulysses hurts me to the core.
Penelope and Telemachus pray for his return,
But it ain't happening, no matter how hard we yearn.

And don't even get me started on Telemachus, man,
He was gonna be like his dad, handsome and tanned.
But something's messed up his head,
Now he's gone to Pylos to search for the undead.

Those suitors in Ithaca are layin' in wait,
Hopin' to leave Telemachus with a bad fate.
But enough 'bout him, let's talk 'bout you,
Where you from? What's your story? I wanna pursue.

How did you get to Ithaca, all alone?
What's your hometown, throw me a bone.
What kinda ship brought you, where'd it dock?
Spill the tea, let's hear you talk.

Yo, Ulysses, spill the tea
Let's hear all about your misery
If food and booze were in our reach
I'd talk for a year without a speech
My story's full of sorrow and pain
But I promise it's not all in vain
The gods have played me like a toy
And messed with me like a bored schoolboy
But don't worry, I won't bore ya
I'll tell it all, like it's Regina George on Mean Girls, oh yeah!

Yo, listen up, let me tell you 'bout my life,
I'm a Cretan, born to a slave, gave me strife,
My dad, Castor, was the man, the hero,
Rich, brave, his lineage far from zero.

I was given a little when he's long gone,
My bros split his wealth, but I'll carry on,
My strength and courage helped me snag a wife,
No need to brag, I don't fear for my life.

In battle, I'm a beast, full of might,
No enemy too strong, they're in my sight,
Farms and kids aren't my thing, you see,
Seafaring and fights are where I feel free.

Before Troy, I led men and ships with pride,
Nine times in command, wealth on the side,
I got the richest spoils, that's the way,
Now you know what's up with me, okay?

Bruh, let me tell you 'bout my life,
I got famous in Crete, no strife.
Then the people told me to go,
To fight in Troy, it was a show.

It took us nine years to take that town,
We battled on, our faces in a frown.
But eventually, we saw success,
And sailed away, our mission to bless.

But then, it seemed like my luck turned,
Jupiter, my fate, he spurned.
I decided to set my sights on Egypt,
Fitted out a fleet, that was my habit.

I had nine ships by my side,
My crew was pumped, we'd take a ride.
We feasted for six whole days,
But then we left, set sail in many ways.

For five days, we sailed so right,
A fair wind behind us, out of sight.
We reached the river, full of hope,
And sent men out to help us cope.

They scouted the land, looked for signs,
We left our ships in safe confines.
But troubles came, not gonna lie,
And we had to fight to stay alive.

Oh my gosh, this story's wild,
It's got drama that's stacked by a mile.
You had your men, your orders,
But they didn't listen, they thought they were bolder.

They took their own path and showed no restraint,
And left destruction in their wake, with lives as the cost they paid.
You regret your choices and wish to be dead,
The sorrow you'd face is still up ahead.

But then you came up with a plan so bizarre,
To go up to the king and put on a façade.
You grasped at his knees, and he let you live,
His kindness you'll remember and to Jove, you'll give.

Those who tried to hurt you were stopped in their rage,
For the king knew that Jove is totally not a fake.
He protects visitors and strangers alike,
Punishing those who do evil, that's his strike.

This story's lit, a real adventure,
It's got everything from start to departure.
Memes and slangs may come and go,
But cool stories like this will remain like whoa!

Yo, I lived with the Egyptians for seven years,
Got mad money from them, brought no tears.
Then came a Phoenician, a real sly dude,
Convinced me to go with him, his house to include.

Stayed for a year, but then it was time to jump,
When he set me on a ship, my heart did thump.
He said we were bound for Libya with cargo to bear,
But I knew deep down, it was a trap, unfair.

His intention was to sell me, and make a quick buck,
But I went along, hoping things won't suck.
Soon enough, we reached the land of Libya,
I'd have to start anew, with no Africa.

That Phoenician, he was a real villain,
But I saw it too late, my heart felt chillin'.
Now I'm in Libya, without a clue,
Wondering what my future will ensue. #LifeLessons #SlaverySucks #GreeceToLibya

Bruh, let me tell ya the tale
Of a ship caught in a fierce gale
Sailing 'tween Crete and Libya's sea
Thinking they'd make it out scot-free

But Jove, that god of thunderbolt power
Sent a black cloud down to devour
The ship with brimstone and flames
As lightning struck without any aims

The men fell like sea-gulls into the deep
Their fate, one that they couldn't keep
But as for the hero of our story
He clung to a mast, full of glory

Drifting for nine days without end
Until on the tenth night, dear friend
A wave brought him to the Thesprotian shore
Where he felt like he couldn't take no more

But then Pheidon, king of the land
Extended a gracious, helping hand
Hospitably entertained our hero, sans charge
And gave him clothes to replace his old, worn-out barge. 

TL;DR - A ship got wrecked thanks to Jove's thunderbolt power, but the hero survived by clinging to a mast and floated to Thesprotian coast where he received hospitable treatment from the king.

Hold up, wait a minute, let me tell you a tale,
Of Ulysses, a legend who went through a treacherous trail.
The king welcomed him with open arms,
Showing him treasures that can make you swoon with their charms.

Gold and iron in heaps and tons,
Enough to provide for not one, but ten generations.
Ulysses sought Jove's guidance in Dodona he went,
To know if his return to Ithaca should be real or just pretend.

The king swore by the gods and made a toast,
That a ship has been prepared, no need to boast.
Before Ulysses returned, he sent me away,
On a Thesprotian ship headed to Dulichium's bay.

The charge was to take me safely to King Acastus' estate,
So I bid farewell to the king and accepted my fate.
Ulysses' journey was far from done, but with hospitality so great,
He must have many stories and adventures to relate.

Okay, okay, okay, listen up y'all
Let me tell you a tale so wild
This dude got caught up in a plan
A scheme so rotten and so grand

The plan was to sell him as a slave
To send him off with nothing but rags to save
They took his clothes, he was left in despair
And then they sailed without a care

But the gods wouldn't let him go down
So they freed him and he didn't drown
He swam to land and hid in a wood
Until he found a good man who understood

Now, he's still alive and kicking
This story is simply so thrilling
From being sold out on the open sea
To finding a way to still be free

Like that Drake meme, what a journey 
From the depths of despair to recovery
With every challenge, he kept on fighting
And never gave up, kept on surviving.

Dang, Eumaeus, that story's wild,
But parts of it sound too mild.
I can't believe your Ulysses tale,
It sounds fishy like a whale.

Why would a man like you lie?
I can't let that pass me by.
I know all about your master's fate,
The gods made him meet a gruesome, terrible date.

They detest him, don't you know?
That's why they made him suffer so.
He should have died with honors high,
But now his fate's up in the sky.

The storm winds came and took him away,
Nobody knows where he went to stay.
So don't spin me those fairy tales,
Or I'll be calling you out for sales.

Yo, I gotta say
This old man is far away
With pigs he resides
Town visits only when Penelope decides

They ask him questions galore
Some grieve, and some want more
To eat up the king's property
Without paying, acting quite haughty

Once he was kind to a man
Who had come a long way from Cretan land
Said he saw Ulysses there
Refitting his ships without a care

He'd come back the next summer or fall
With much wealth for one and all
But now fate has brought this man to his door
Kindness will come out of respect for Jove, nothing more

Ay, ay, Ulysses, you're quite the pro,
But your word I take with a grain of dough,
A cloak and shirt for you, if your story's true,
But if not, we'll toss you from that steep preview.

The gods above will be our witnesses,
As we make this deal, minus the business,
Of hashtags, "yo's" and all that noise,
Just a simple oath, for grown-up boys.

If your master returns as you foretell,
You'll be clothed and sent off pell-mell,
But if not, oh tramp of little thought,
We'll give you a warning, with a most lethal toss.

So, Ulysses, let's make this deal,
In all honesty, let's make it real,
For the internet's watching, we must not fail,
To be true to our word, or we'll be in travail.
