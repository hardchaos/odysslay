Yo, Penelope my girl, don't you worry
Our boy Odysseus came through in a hurry
He fought off the suitors like a boss
Singlehandedly, no extra loss

The nurse Euryclea, she saw it all
And now Penelope's crying, standing tall
But let me tell you, it wasn't luck
Odysseus was prepared, he didn't duck

He knew the suitors' every move
Like a gamer playing in the groove
His plan was tight, his aim was true
He hit those suitors outta the blue

So now you can breathe a sigh of relief
Your husband's back, like a total beef
No need to worry, he's here to stay
And with him, the suitors went away!

Oh dang, Euryclea, what you sayin'?
I'm keen to know what's been playin'! 
You heard them groaning, you heard the brawl?
What happened? C'mon, spill it all!

You were hiding with the women, all cloistered up
While Ulysses fought like a boss, didn't give up.
He stood over the corpses, blood and filth everywhere
Like a lion who'd just made his latest kill, totally aware.

The corpses are now in the outer court,
Ulysses even purged the house, that's worth a shout!
Girl, your man's sending for ya, callin' your name,
He's finally home, and things ain't the same.

Finally y'all can be together,
Partyin' like birds of a feather!
Your husband's back with you and your son,
And he's gonna take revenge on those who shunned.

So let's go, girl! No need to stall,
Ulysses has returned, he's the king of 'em all!
It's time to celebrate, let's get wild,
Like O-M-G, this is totally tiled!

Oh Penelope, don't be blue,
What you're sayin' just cannot be true!
It's likely the gods up above
Are angry at the suitors and their love
For evil and wickedness, they're to blame
And now they're gone, what a shame!
Ulysses is far away,
But perhaps, he'll return someday!
Don't be fooled by what you hear,
Anything can happen in a year!
Maybe it was Poseidon's vengence,
Or Zeus who gave the final sentence.
But one thing we know for sure,
The suitors messed up, that's for sure.
Now, let's hope it's not just a rumor,
And Ulysses will come home, like a true consumer!

Hold up, wait a sec, what's that you say?
Your hubby's in the house, chillin' by the hearth all day?
Don't be in disbelief, it's totally true,
And I've got proof to show to you.

When I was washin' him up, I saw a scar,
From where a wild boar had left its mark so far,
I wanted to give you the tea real quick,
But your man shut me down, hushin' my lips quick.

So why don't you come with me, and we'll strike a deal,
If I'm lyin', then you can make me feel...real pain,
But I swear on my life, I'm not playin',
Your hubby's in the house, no delaying.

So come along, let's go and see,
Your man, your love, your hubby, your G.

"Okay, boomer," I replied with a smile,
But let's go find your son, it's been a while.
The gods may work in mysterious ways,
But we'll find him, even if it takes days.

I'm totally down to see those dead bozos,
And the man who took care of their egos.
Let's hop on this search like we're on TikTok,
And get it done before the sun hits the top.

Our journey may be long and a bit rocky,
But it's worth it to see that killer's hockey.
So put on your shades and let's hit the road,
We'll find your son, and its beauty will explode.

Yo, Penelope, what's good, what's the sitch?
I see you eyeing Odysseus like he just fell off a ditch.
You're wondering if you should keep your distance or go for the hug,
But it seems like you're tripping on this man's shabby rug.

Ulysses is sitting there, looking lowkey upset,
While you're just staring at him, acting all suspenseful and set.
Girl, you gotta realize, it's your man, the king,
Telemachus is calling you out, what's with the not recognizing thing?

Come on, Penelope, don't act like a boomer,
You're a boss queen, the one and only consumer.
Step up and give your man a tight embrace,
Stop hesitating and let him see your face.

This is a moment to celebrate and bond,
No need to be acting all shy or fond.
Just show Odysseus that you still got it,
And that you'll always love and support it.

Oh my mom, you're so savage, 
Why you acting like a savage? 
Dad is back, after twenty years, 
But you're not wiping away those tears. 

You won't even sit by his side, 
What's up with that, why do you hide? 
No other woman would act like this, 
But you keep up this cold abyss. 

Your heart is as hard as a rock, 
What's going on, what's the talk? 
Why not ask dad some questions, 
And break away from these rejections? 

Let's solve this mystery, like Nancy Drew, 
So we can be like Kim and Kanye too.

Oh snap, Penelope's mind is blown
She's seeing things she thought were gone
Ulysses, her man, she thought was dead
But now he's standing there, right by her bed

She can't believe her eyes, she's in shock
Her words are lost, she can't even talk
But deep down, she knows it must be true
'Cause there are secrets that only they two knew

It's like a plot twist in a mystery show
Ulysses is back, let the people know
The ultimate comeback, like a phoenix from the ashes
Penelope sees him now, no need for glasses

This reunion is straight up legendary
Like when SpongeBob met Sandy
Or when Drake said "Started from the bottom"
Ulysses is back, he's come to rock'em

Penelope and Ulysses, a power duo
Like Kim and Kanye, or chips and queso
They'll get to know each other once again
Their love story continues, let it begin!

Yo, Telemachus, let's not get caught up in this fuss,
Your mom's trippin' cause I'm looking like I'm covered in dust.
She's testing me, making sure I'm legit,
Believing I'm someone else just cause my clothes ain't a perfect fit.

But let's move on, my dude, and think about what to do,
We just wiped out the finest youth Ithaca ever knew!
When you take a life, you gotta run from your peeps,
But with our situation, where do we even begin to creep?

Let's bounce before we get caught, hit the road and take flight,
Pray to the gods we don't end up in an endless night.
But don't worry, my bro, I got this, trust in me,
We'll find our way outta here and be free as a bee.

Yo pops, we know you're the GOAT,
The wisest of them all, that's what they quote,
Telemachus and I are ready to roll,
We'll follow your lead and achieve our goal.

They say you're the one who knows it all,
No mortal man can compare or stand tall,
We'll give it our all, our strength won't fail,
Together, as a team, we'll surely prevail.

Yo, Ulysses spittin' straight fire,
No time to dwell and mope, just retire.
First thing's first, change your attire,
Shirts on, and maids too, let's inspire.

Phemius, strike up a tune, make it lit,
The sound will ring through, make a hit,
People outside will think we're having a fit,
No talk of death, our plan will be a skit.

In the woods we'll hide, make a real choice,
Take what heaven sends, listen to its voice.
No more suitors, no more noise,
Ulysses' victory, the ultimate rejoice.

Oh dang, Phemius on the lyre
Got everybody feeling the fire
Men and women dancing with grace
This party got such a dope pace

People be talkin' 'bout the queen
Sayin' she's been gettin' mean
Not protecting her man's stuff
But let's not be too tough

Cuz Penelope's been holdin' it down
Hoping that her man will be found
So let's raise a glass to the queen
And let this lit party be seen!

Yo, Ulysses was back from the sea,
After twenty years, he's sipping tea.
Eurynome washed him up and groomed,
Minerva glammed him up, fully bloomed.

With hyacinth curls and beauty so bold,
Ulysses was godlike, we're told.
He sat down by his wife, Penelope,
She's tougher than most, a true MVP.

Ulysses said, "My dear, you're strong like a titan,
No woman could bear to hold back from fighting."
But the wife's heart was hard like steel,
Ulysses wanted a bed, a cozy deal.

"Get me a bed," he asked with poise,
"I'll sleep alone, no womanly noise."
Penelope's heart stayed strong and true,
Ulysses was back, what a hullabaloo!

Oh snap, Penelope is dropping bombs!
Not impressed by the man from whence he comes
Euryclea's getting ready to move things around
Moving the bed and all, no need to be tightly wound

Fleeces, coverlets, and blankets galore
She wants this man to rest up and not be sore
Penelope knows the power of a good snooze
She's making sure he's cozy with no option to refuse

And let's not forget about that bed
Built by the man, it's where he should lay his head
This queen knows what she's doing, oh so sly
With her wits and charm, she'll catch anyone's eye

As for the man, well he may not impress
But in Penelope's eyes, she sees the best
And with Euryclea on her team
They'll make sure he rests, like he's living a dream

Can I get an "ok boomer" for all the men who fall short?
Penelope's taking charge, giving them a retort 
She knows her worth and won't settle for less 
That's what makes her the ultimate queen, nothing but finesse.

Hold up, Ulysses ain't playin',
His wife's words have him dismayin'.
Someone moved his bed out of place,
And he's ready to pick up the pace.

Like seriously, who did this deed,
What kind of skills did they need?
It's not just any ordinary bed,
A true masterpiece, as he once said.

The post's made from an olive tree,
And trust me, it's not light as a bee.
Ulysses made it with his own hands,
And now, someone made shifting it their demands.

Did a god come down to assist,
Or is the perpetrator a skilled catalyst?
Let's be real, it's not an easy feat,
And Ulysses is not one to be beat.

He worked on it with gold and silver,
Crafted with precision, not just a shiver.
And don't even get me started on the hide,
Crimson leather, Ulysses had nothing to hide.

So, someone better 'fess up real quick,
Cause Ulysses is in detective mode, not slick.
Tell him if the bed's still in place,
Or if your guilt is written on your face.

Dang, Ulysses, you speak the truest truth
It's like you're the smartest sleuth
Penelope can't help but be overcome
Her tears flow like a never-ending hum

"Don't be mad, yo, you're the wisest guy
We've both suffered, it's made me wanna cry
We can't even be together when we're old
But I'm sorry I hugged you later, I'm not so bold"

She's been shivering with fear, so much stress
Thought someone might give her a lying "yes"
There's mad wicked people about, I'm not kiddin'
But now she trusts you, it's like you're her best kitten

Hey, Helen messed up big thanks to heaven above
She didn't even think about that sin, love
But now there's no doubt, Penelope knows
You're the only one who's seen what's under those throws

So don't trip, Ulysses, she's all in
The truth you've shown has totally won

Yo, this scene is straight outta a rom-com flick,
Ulysses and Penelope, their love is thick.
He's been gone a decade, and she's still not over it,
But now he's back, and she can't help but submit.

As they embrace, tears fall from their eyes,
Like when you're chopping onions and you can't disguise
The fact that you're crying, but it's not from sadness,
It's from pure joy, and the feeling of completeness and gladness.

Their love is like a lighthouse in a stormy sea,
A beacon of hope for all to see,
And just like sailors, lost and alone,
They find solace in the fact that they've finally come home.

Minerva, the goddess, puts a stop to their embrace,
For she knows that this scene doesn't need an encore or another take.
So she holds back the night, and keeps Dawn at bay,
Until it's time for Ulysses to start his new day. 

This reunion is sweet, like a meme that's wholesome,
Or a TikTok dance that really hits home.
Their love is epic, like a saga or a tale,
And their bond is unbreakable, like a hashtag that never fails.

Yaaas, Ulysses, that's the spirit, don't sleep on your dreams!
Your journey's still on, it seems.
Teiresias prophesied that this ain't easy street,
But don't sweat it, you're still lit and can't be beat!
Let's hit the hay now, let's get some rest,
Sleepin' like a boss will give us our best.

Yo, Penelope, you lookin' fine,  
Heard you want to know what's on my mind.  
The gods brought me back, it's true  
But now, my girl, I got work to do. 

See, I'm tasked with a quest, a mighty feat  
It's up to me to make our kingdom complete  
And though I'll tell you later, please understand  
I gotta go do this thing and take a stand. 

But don't you worry, queen so kind  
I'll be back in no time, so never mind  
Until then, get some rest, catch some Z's  
Just stay fly like the queen you please.  

And as for me, I'll be on my way  
To do this task, come what may  
So let's say our goodbyes, adios, farewell  
And catch up later, with a story to tell.

Oh dear, why you gotta press me so? 
Fine, I'll tell you, but it's a no-go. 
Teiresias told me to grab an oar,
And travel until I can't go no more.
To a land untouched by the salty waves, 
Where they don't mix salt in their raves. 
A traveler will ask if my oar's a shovel,
Which will make my journey, truly novel. 
I'll place my oar down and sacrifice beasts,
To Neptune, god of the ocean's feasts. 
Then I'll head home, and to the gods I'll pray,
With hecatombs, each and every day. 
Teiresias said I'll die by the sea,
As the waves take me to eternity. 
And when I'm old, mind at ease,
My people will bless me, everyone will appease.

Oh my gosh Penelope, you killed it!
Your lit rhyme game, I can't resist it!
Talking 'bout the gods and their fate,
But you know what they say, it's never too late.
You deserve some peace in your later days,
'Cause let's be real, life can be like a maze.
But with your strength and grace, you'll overcome,
Like that meme, "You vs. the guy she told you not to worry about," you've won!

As Ulysses and Penelope walked down the hall, 
Eurynome made sure the bed was ready for their fall. 
With torches lighting their way to rest, 
They settled in for a night of peacefulness.

The nurse left to sleep, but Eurynome stayed, 
Guiding the couple to where they'd lay. 
And as they snuggled up in their old bed, 
Joy ran through their bodies - no more feeling dread.

The men stopped dancing and told the women to cease, 
Laying down to sleep in the breezy, cool peace. 
Another night of adventure finally comes to a close, 
And our hero Ulysses can finally doze.

Oh my gosh, Penelope and Ulysses, what a pair,
Talking all night, no one else would dare.
The suitors were wicked, drinking so much wine,
Killing animals and causing a major decline.

Penelope struggled, seeing it all,
Ulysses too, his story was a long haul.
He gave the deets, every trouble he had faced,
And she listened to it all, not one detail misplaced.

They talked all night, not a wink of sleep,
Their bond growing stronger, memories to keep.
Penelope was delighted, listening to his past,
Their love so strong, it was bound to last!

My girl, let me tell you, Odysseus was the man,
who went on a journey, that no one else can.

He defeated the Cicons, oh what a feat,
then reached the Lotus-eaters, and had a tasty treat.

The Cyclops was next, with his ruthless ways,
He punished him good, it was time he paid.

He went to Aeolus, the man was kind,
but a hurricane hit, and he was in a bind.

The Laestrygonians were some mean folks,
they destroyed his ships, made it hard to cope.

Circe, the witch, was next on his list,
her magic was crafty, he couldn't resist.

He went to Hades, to talk with the dead,
he saw comrades and family, thoughts filled his head.

The Siren's singing put him in a trance,
but he escaped, and went on with his dance.

Charybdis and Scylla were a sailor's nightmare,
but he got through, with not even a scare.

His men ate the sun-god's cattle, oh how sad,
Jupiter struck them down, it was oh so bad.

Odysseus survived, all on his own,
he made it to the Ogygian island, but he still wasn't home.

Calypso, the nymph, wanted him as her groom,
but he said no, she couldn't seal the tomb.

Finally, he made it to the Phaeacians' land,
who treated him well, oh wasn't that grand.

Gold, bronze, and raiment, they gave him so much,
Odysseus, the hero, still had that final touch.

And that's the end of his tale,
his eyes began to close, like a sagacious snail.

Minerva dished out another plan,
As Ulysses rested from being a wanted man,
She asked Dawn to rise and bring light,
And illumine the world so bright.

Ulysses then sprung up from his bed,
And said to Penelope with words unsaid,
"Darling, we both faced a ton of strife,
Me, longing to come home, you, mourning my life.

Now that we're together, I need you to know,
Take care of the house, our tales will show,
And as for the goats, the suitors have taken,
I will take forceful action, no need for forsaken.

I'll take sheep by force from other lots,
Make the Achaeans fill my plots,
Now, I'm off to visit my father in the woods,
And to you, these words I've understood.

As soon as sunrise, I'll be the talk of town,
That I killed the suitors, and wore their crown,
So go upstairs, and with your ladies stay,
Ask no questions, let rumors sway."

I'm telling you, this story is tight!
Ulysses and his squad are about to take flight.
They suited up and got their armor on,
Ready to attack from dusk 'till dawn.

Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus too,
All strapped up, looking like they're about to do
Something epic, something super cool,
Something that would make a fool drool.

They blasted past the town's open gates,
Ready to unleash their fates.
It was bright outside but Minerva had the magic juice,
To make them disappear like a frantic bunny hare on the loose.

Yooooo what's up in the hizzy,
I've got a crazy story that's gonna make you dizzy.
It's all about this dude, a total chad,
Who went on a trip and things got bad.

He was heading to the beach, ready to catch some sun,
But he forgot his sunscreen, and that was no fun.
The UV rays hit him hard, his skin turned red,
He looked like a lobster, and wished he stayed in bed.

But that's not even the worst of it, my friend,
He got lost on the way back, and that's no pretend.
He wandered for hours, with no phone service or map,
He was straight-up lost, and that's a fact.

But then, out of nowhere, he heard a voice,
It was the sound of a hero, and he had no choice.
He looked up and saw a man with a majestic beard,
He was relieved, and he cheered.

The man offered to help, and led him out of the woods,
And just like that, he realized he was one of the goods.
He thanked the man and gave him a fist bump,
And in that moment, he knew he was no chump.

So the moral of the story, my squad,
Is to always be prepared, and give thanks to a mod.
And if you ever get lost, just remember,
A good samaritan might just save the day, no dismember.

BOOK XXIV

Yo peeps, let me tell you a story,  
Of the ghostly suitors, not just any ordinary.  
Mercury, holdin' up his golden wand,  
Woke up the dead by just a mere command.  

They followed him like bats in a cave,  
Whinin' and squealin', it was like a rave.  
Traversing the waters of Oceanus and Leucas rock,  
They reached the gates of dreams, what a shock.  

The meadow of asphodel, where the souls reside,  
Who couldn't work no more and thus had died.  
Their shadows loomed, it was quite a sight,  
Mercury leading the way with all his might.

Bro, let me tell you a tale so wild,
It's got the ghosts of warriors that were once styled
Achilles, the son of Peleus fierce,
Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, a man without a pierce.

These were the dudes that fought in Troy,
With bravery that we still enjoy.
Ajax stood out with his looks so fine,
And a warrior skill that would always shine.

Now they've come back as ghostly spirits,
The thought of which gives me the jitters.
But imagine dapping them up with a friendly hey,
And with these legends, spending the day.

I mean, Achilles was like the Zeus of Greeks,
Ajax was built like the Hercules physique.
And with Patroclus and Antilochus by their side,
Their history is something you can never hide.

So when you hear ghosts of warriors so grand,
Remember them, cuz they were once the hottest in the land.
#WarriorsGonnaWar #RIP #GreekMythology

The ghosts all around, it's quite a sight,
Achilles spoke up with all his might.
Agamemnon, sobbing, was filled with sorrow,
As they gathered here, in the dead of tomorrow.

The shades of Aeisthus' victims were there,
All together in the ghostly air.
In the midst of this eerie scene,
Achilles' ghost was looking quite keen.

He started off the conversation right,
"Yo, what's up guys? This is quite the sight!
Why are we all here, in this tragic state?
Is there something we need to debate?"

Agamemnon's ghost, with tears in his eyes,
Replied back, "We're all here, under these skies,
To mourn our fates and seek some closure."
Achilles nodded, "I feel your composure."

The shades gathered close, a ghostly crew,
As Achilles spoke, "I know what to do.
Let's honor the fallen and remember the dead,
And keep their memory alive, better than bread." 

So they stood there, in the afterlife,
Honoring their fallen with no strife.
With a nod of agreement, they began to depart,
Their love for each other forever in their heart.

Oh snap, yo, listen up real quick,
Apollo's speakin', he's makin' a slick
Comment 'bout Atreus' offspring, Achilles,
Said Zeus loved him best, gave him the thrill-est
Life a hero could have, all epic and stuff,
Fightin' with the Greeks, who were always tough.

But death don't discriminate, it comes for all,
Even for heroes who stand tall,
At Troy he would've been hailed, if he bit the dust,
Now no one even knows, his bones filled with rust.
Poor dude, his end was just real sad,
No montages, no hype, no one's really glad.

Yo, Peleus' offspring, you were quite savage,
Fighting at Troy, as Trojans tried to ravage,
Around your body, there were heaps of dead,
And there you lay, heedless, as the dust lead.
All day we fought, but Jove stopped our brawl,
Else we'd still be fighting, answering his call.
Once we bore you to the ship safely,
We cleansed your skin with oils rich and timely.
The Danaans were wailing, crying, and tense,
Your mother came with her nymphs, intense,
Over the waters a wail echoed so loud,
Achaeans were scared, minds jumbled, and proud.
Nestor was wise, and he calmed their fears,
"Stay, Argives, this is no reason for tears,
This is his mother, who came from the sea,
To view the body of her son, Achea, with me."

Bro, the Achaeans were shooketh no more, 
With the daughters of the old sea man who tore, 
Gathered 'round you, weeping like a pack of wolves, 
Clothed you in clothes, slicker than Uwu's fox gloves. 

The muses came through with sweet laments, 
Weeping and wailing like it was no sense,
Not one Argive didn't join in the cry,
For they felt it deeply, no need to lie.

In mourning, we spent 17 long nights, 
Weeping hot, sad tears with all our might,
But on the eighteenth day, we said goodbye,
Offering up sheep and oxen to the sky.

Cloaked in divine raiment, and honey-soaked, 
Heroes clashed their swords, leaving the ground smoked,
And when the fires of Hephaestus had done their task, 
We gathered your pure white bones without much ask.

With pure wine and ointments, we cared for you so, 
With a vase of gold gifted by Bacchus, don't you know? 
While warriors and comrades kept watch as you lay, 
Like the loss of Antilochus and Pat yearning to play.

Yo, the Argives built a tomb so fine,
To be seen on the Hellespont's line.
Your mother prayed to the gods above,
And gave prizes that the Achaeans love.

You might have seen many hero's hours,
When young men compete for sweet powers.
But nothing beats the gifts given by Thetis,
To honour you, the bravest on all lists.

Even death couldn't take away your fame, 
Your name still lives in every man's claim.
What about me? What do I gain?
Jove's wrath was my only stain.

Aegisthus and my wife did me in,
Destroyed all that I did win.
But yo, we gotta sail on, you and me,
And keep shining bright like the sun at sea.

Yo, the ghosts of suitors came with a force.
Mercury brought them through, of course.
Agamemnon and Achilles were shocked at the sight,
Seeing their killers in front of them, not feeling alright.
Agamemnon spotted Amphimedon and went to say hi,
They conversed like old friends, about Ithaca that guy.
Mercury played the role of guide,
As the ghosts talked, not fought or lied.
This meeting was lit, full of surprises galore.
But we gotta go now, can't stay no more.

Yo, what's up with you guys, tell me true - 
Why are y'all down here, what did ya do?
Seriously, you're a good-looking crew,
Why are you underground, what's the hullabaloo?

Did the sea god slap you with his wrath,
Or did enemies cross your path?
Were you lifting cattle and got in trouble,
Or fighting for wives - did it get too much to handle?

Come on, seriously, don't leave me hanging,
I was your guest, don't leave me guessing.
I remember coming to your home,
With Menelaus, wanting Ulysses to roam.

It took us forever to set sail,
Come on, guys, tell me the tale.

Yo, Agamemnon, your story is ancient,
But let me retell it, make it more vibrant.
Amphimedon's ghost has all the tea,
About how Penelope played a trick on thee.

She sewed a pall for Laertes, oh so grand,
But really, it was a cleverly crafted plan.
She pretended to work on it day and night,
But under torchlight, she unpicked it, tight.

Three years went by, and we didn't catch on,
But in the fourth, the secret was gone.
One of her maids spilled the tea to us,
Penelope had to finish the robe in a fuss.

When she was done, it shone like the moon,
But her plan to foil the suitors was much attune.
So, Agamemnon, that's the scoop,
Penelope used her needles like a boss, don't droop.

Oh my, let me tell you what happened, 
Ulysses landed on the farm with intentions so savage,
He and his son Telemachus came with a plot so malicious,
All to destroy the suitors, it was simply vicious!

Telemachus came first, then Ulysses came a-limping,
Looking like some beggar who was skin and bones, lacking,
But the suitors threw things, insulted him with no holding back,
Little did they know, their fate was sealed, they were under attack!

Ulysses and his son hid the armor out of sight,
And cunningly made Penelope give them a bow, so bright,
No one could string it, no one could nearly do so,
But Ulysses strung it with ease, his skill, they didn't know!

He sent his arrow through the iron and then,
Killed Antinous, the suitors were shaking, they were not zen,
He poured his arrows on the floor and aimed straight,
The suitors fell like dominos, there was no escape for their fate!

It was like the gods had helped him, for the suitors had no chance,
They fell upon the cloisters, like they were in some trance,
Their brains were battered, their blood was on the ground,
Their end had come, a gruesome sight to be found!

Their bodies were lying, un-cared for in Ulysses' house,
Their friends did not know, their death had caused,
So, they lay there, with their wounds, so black,
Their final moan unheard, their death so wack!

Yo Ghost Agamemnon, it's lit to see
How highly you praise Penelope
She's got the brains and the beauty so rare
That all of Greece just couldn't compare

The immortals will write a song so sweet
In Penelope's honour, it'll be a treat
So loyal to her man, she's the perfect wife
Every girl wants to live that kinda life

But Clytemnestra, she's a whole different story
She killed her hubby, it's kinda gory
She brought shame on all women, not just the bad
Now no one really wants to be like her, it's pretty sad

"Guys, we've arrived at Laertes' place, let's be slick,
Here he spends his days on this farm that's so chic,
He worked super hard to get this land looking so clean,
It's a sight for sore eyes, if you know what I mean.

His house is simple, but it's where he rests his head,
The roof is made from straw, but don't you be misled,
The slaves chill in the lean-to, after a long day,
And inside there's a Sicel woman that's here to stay.

Telemachus, let's go inside and greet Laertes,
And maybe after, we can all grab some sweet crepes,
I hope he recognizes us, our disguise is so fire,
Our threads are even sleeker than a painted up tire!"

"Yo, hit up the crib and slay the fattest swine,
While I flex on my pops with this drip so fine.
Will he recognize me after all this time?
Or will his memory be as washed up as Vine?

I'm eager to see if he's all good,
Or if he needs a refresh, like he's misunderstood.
But first, let's get that hog on the plate,
And chow down like we're running late.

So let's get this pig and make it quick,
Before someone else grabs it like a TikTok trend gone slick."

Yo, Ulysses was walking in the field,
Looking for his father who had to yield.
He saw him digging in the bed,
Wearing a goat skin cap on his head.

Ulysses stood there, started to weep,
Couldn't believe what he saw; his heart did leap.
He thought of hugging him tight,
But then, he decided to be witty and bright.

He approached his father, with a plan in mind,
To trick him before he is confined.
His dad was looking very shabby,
And Ulysses' emotions were really cabby.

He saw the hoe, the vine and the pear,
And he knew why he had to come out and dare.
He had to reclaim his rightful home,
And for that, he had to roam.

Now, Ulysses needed to act clever,
Not to reveal who he was, ever.
And he thought of a way to break the ice
And trick his dad, oh so twice.

Yo, Ulysses, my bro, you're quite the observer,
Your gardener skills are lit, like you're a master server.
Every plant, vine, flower bed, is top-notch,
Your attention to detail is just watch.

But don't get offended if I say, 
That you take better care of your crops than your own dismay.
Your clothes are old, and you unclean,
It's a sight that's quite obscene.

But it's clear as day, you're not an ordinary peasant,
Your looks suggest, that you're a noble present.
So spill the tea and tell me true, 
Whose bondman are you, and where do you pursue?

Is this place really Ithaca, so grand?
I met a guy who said it was, but he didn't understand.
He wasn't patient enough, to hear me out,
When I asked about a friend and what he's about.

My friend's name was one that he would know,
But not a chance did he give me, to help my flow.
My friend was last named Laertes, son of Arceisius,
A king's son, not some mere alias.

He visited me once, when I was home,
Out of all strangers, he was the best to roam.
He said he was from Ithaca, his homeland,
And I showered him with gifts, it was quite grand.

I gifted him talents of gold, seven to be exact,
A cup of silver, so fine with flowers that lacked,
Clothes, rugs, mantles, and shirts galore,
And four women skilled to the core.

So tell me true, oh gardener so fine,
Is this Ithaca, the land that's mine?

Oh dang, pops, it's a bummer
To hear that your son's six feet under
Your wealth of gifts won't do a thing
The wicked here don't care to sing

If you found your friend in Ithaca
He'd share his crib, no need to pack-a
But let me ask, and do be truthful
How long since your friend was youthful?

Alas, he's dead, gone, no more
Fish ate him up, a total bore
Or maybe birds, or beasts so wild
Father and mother, cries compiled

Poor Penelope, his wife so fair
No shroud to wrap, no final tear
So, spill the tea, tell us your tale
Your town, your parents and that ship's trail

Yo, lemme spill the tea,
It’s your boy, Eperitus, don’t you see?
I come from Alybas, a place so fine,
My crib’s got everything, it’s a big shine.

I’m the son of King Apheidas, oh so grand,
My grandpa’s Polypemon, a legendary man.
But heaven played me, took me off my course,
Ended up here, it wasn’t my choice, of course.

My ship is chillin’ outside of town,
It’s been 5 years, Ulysses left, he’s not around.
We saw good omens as we said goodbye,
Birds flew on our right, we both felt high.

We hoped for a friendly meeting so sweet,
With gifts for each other, a kind hearted feat.

Yo pops, don't fret, it's me, your boy    
Returned after twenty years of joy    
I see your tears, your sorrow deep    
Let me hug you tight in a loving heap    

I've been away, but now I'm back    
Ready to pick up any slack    
But we must hurry, there's no time to waste    
I've been busy at home, putting the suitor's pace    

I punished them hard, for their crimes and insolence    
They had no business usurping my residence    
Now come on, let's go, we've got to move    
There's a lot to catch up on, and so much to prove    

So let's be quick, and hit the road    
Our adventure together, will never get old    
But first, let's hug it out, and shed a tear    
For twenty years apart, is way too much to bear    

*yeehaw*

"Yo pops, don't you stress,
I'll prove I'm your son, no need to second-guess.
I'll show you my tat, see if it rings a bell,
And then we can catch up and chat and dwell.

But wait there's more, I've got a meme for you,
A Drake Hotline Bling, will that do?
And if you're still not convinced,
I'll show you my skills, no need to make sense!"

Laertes looked at Ulysses with a grin,
Impressed by his son's modern spin.
"I believe you now, my dear boy,
Welcome home, let's celebrate with joy!"

"Yo, check this out," said Ulysses with swag,
"This scar on my skin, it's no rag.
I got it hunting a giant boar,
On Mount Parnassus, it was hardcore.

You sent me to grandpa Autolycus,
For gifts promised to me, no fuss.
And in the garden, you told me about the trees,
Thirteen pear, ten apple, and forty fig, oh please!

You also gifted me fifty rows of vines,
With corn planted between, yielding juicy wines.
The grapes they produce, they are so divine,
When the heat from the sun does shine."

Laertes was at a loss, 
he heard his son's words with exhaustion and toss, 
his strength failed him, he couldn't stand,
Ulysses had to hold him with his hands.

He embraced tight, 
as Ulysses held with all his might. 
"Father Jove, the gods are still in town,"
he exclaimed with a serious frown.

The gods punished the suitors for their misdeeds, 
their insolence and foolishness had come to an end, indeed. 
But Laertes was afraid of what was to come,
he might have the townspeople bringing their drums.

All the cities in Cephallenia would be alerted,
for the news of Ithaca's betrayal had been asserted.
Laertes feared the worst, 
but his son Ulysses was there to quench his thirst.

Oh snap, Ulysses is back in the mix
No time to waste, let's get our dinner fix
He's telling his crew to head to a house nearby
To feast and chill, it's gonna be lit, don't be shy
Philoetius, Telemachus, and Eumaeus, they're all down
Cooking up some grub, like the coolest chefs in town

As they walked and talked,
Towards the house, they strolled and walked,
When they arrived they found a party,
Cutting meat and wine, living hearty.

Laertes was old, he needed some care,
The Sicel woman helped, and removed his wear and tear,
Cleaned him up and made him feel brand new,
Minerva made him taller, without any rear view.

When he returned with a glow,
Telemachus stared, and said "Oh woah!",
"You look like a god, who did this to you?",
Laertes smiled, knowing it was true.

Yo, Laertes, I totally feel ya, G
Wish you were as strong as you used to be
Grab your armor and weapons, make 'em see
That you're not someone they can easily flee

Your rule o'er the Cephallenians, such a feat
Took a fortress, Nericum, so elite
But now, with the suitors, you can't compete
Need some help, need some soldiers to meet

If you were here yesterday, all dressed
In armor, sword in hand, ready to impress
The suitors would be gone, no need to stress
And we would have thrown a party, no less

They sat down at last, and feasted with glee,
Old Dolius and his sons, and Ulysses did they see,
They stood there, amazed, at the sight of his face,
But Ulysses just watched, with a calm and cool grace.

He chowed down on some food, with a grin on his lips,
"Hey, old man, sit down, and take a few sips!"
Old Dolius just nodded, with tears in his eyes,
And said, "It's so good to see you, and hear your wise lies."

They ate and drank, with a joyous sound,
Old friends reunited, and laughter all around,
And even though they had been gone for so long,
The love between them still remained strong.

Ulysses smiled, at the end of this feast,
And said, "It's good to be back with the people I love the most, at least!"
And they all just laughed, and gave him a hug,
And said, "You're still the same, Ulysses, you old thug!"

Aye, Dolius, my dude, I'm back on my grind
And it feels so lit to be home and unwind
I'm blessed by the gods to be with my friends
And crushing these trials feels like it never ends

You ask if Penelope knows that I'm here
Nah, bro, not yet, gonna give her a cheer
First things first, I need to freshen up and chill
Then I'll surprise her with my return and fulfill

But seriously, Dolius, you the man with the plan
Always holding it down like only you can
Let's get lit and catch up on all that's gone down
And raise a glass to being back in my hometown.

"Yo, Ulysses you lit kingpin,
No need to fret, his daughter knows, it's a win-win."
He took his seat, greeted by sons, no holding back,
Hugs and high fives, they're a tight pack.
Seating arrangement sorted, Dolius the father,
These homies stick together, that's all that matters.

Can you believe the tea that's being spilled?
Rumours flowing, truth getting killed.
The suitors lost their lives, oh my!
The townsfolk gathered, asking why.

They buried each man in his place,
Sent others to their hometown's face.
All while the people gathered round,
Angry and upset, with a common sound.

Eupeithes spoke, tears in his eyes,
Said Ulysses caused all these goodbyes.
Took ships and men, now killing all,
We must act fast and give him a call.

Before he runs to Pylos or Elsewhere,
We need to show him that we care.
Or be shamed forevermore,
Let's avenge our sons who went before.

I tell you, I'm ready to fight,
Won't stop till we make it right.
Let's go, before they get too far,
Crossing over to the mainland, Ulysses leaving a scar.

All eyes were wet, for he was in strife
But Medon and Phemius arrived in the night
Podium was shook, all eyes filled with sight
Hold up, Ithaca, listen to my might

Ulysses acted under higher powers' call
Mentor by his side, who saw it all
From encouraging whispers to a vengeful brawl
The suitors' end, the god would install

"Yo, listen up, crew, don't be afraid,
I know this scene, I'm not dismayed,
I'm Halitherses, wise and true,
My knowledge will guide us through.

Past and future, I know it all,
This situation's not gonna stall,
Hold tight, fam, don't lose your heads,
We'll overcome, we won't be dead.

Trust me, I've got a hundred percent,
We'll come out of this, it's not the end,
We'll beat this thing, just wait and see,
Believe in me, trust in me.

Like that meme about a cat,
Let's be fearless, not scaredy-cats,
We'll go forth and slay this feat,
With each other, we can't be beat."

Yo, peeps of Ithaca, listen up,
This situation is a total screw-up,
You didn't heed my words, nor my mentor's voice,
And now you're dealing with some major noise.

Your sons were acting mad, going insane,
Wasting money, and causing pain,
Disrespecting the queen, thinking no one will know,
But now it's time to face the blow.

Don't take on Ulysses, don't be a fool,
Or else, you'll drown in your own pool,
So listen closely, and do what I say,
It's the only way to save the day.

Memes and slang, I got them all,
Stay away from Ulysses, or else you'll fall.

Yo, Halitherses dropped some truth bombs,
But half the crowd thought it was all wrong.
Eupeithes had a crazy idea,
To start a war, with all his peers, ya hear?

They geared up, in all their might,
Thinking they'd avenge his son's plight.
But little did they know, it wasn't destiny,
Eupeithes was about to suffer, the ultimate penalty.

He led the charge, with his head held high,
Thinking their victory was nigh.
But fate had other plans in store,
And Eupeithes' foolishness led to his downfall, for sure. 

Internet trolls and haters beware,
Don't mess with destiny, or you'll be in despair.
Halitherses spoke the truth, no doubt,
And his words shut down Eupeithes' clout.

Hold up, Minerva, don't fret
Let's talk about peace, don't you forget
Jove, you're the king, what's the plan?
Will you let the fighting expand, or stop it like a fan?

You've got the power, you're the master
Will you let the fighting go faster?
Or will you bring peace to this war
And stop this madness like never before?

Minerva's a queen, you know she's right
Let's make a truce and end this fight
So Jove, tell us what you're thinking
Will you stop this madness, or let it keep sinking?

Remember, you're the king of all
Let's end this rivalry, once and for all
So what's it going to be, let's hear it loud
Will you stop this fight and save the crowd?

Yo, Athena, why you gotta ask me?
Didn't you arrange things for Ulysses, can't you see?
Do whatever you want, but listen to me,
Here's what I think would be the most reasonable decree.

Ulysses is avenged, the suitors got what they deserved,
Now let them swear a solemn oath to keep their words.
Let Ulysses hold the throne and continue to rule,
While the others forgive and forget, don't be cruel.

They can all be friends and peace can reign supreme,
Forget the past, let go of the extreme.
No need for grudges or hate,
Let's move on and celebrate.

It's time to end this whole saga,
No more bloodshed, no more drama.
Let's live our lives with peace and love,
And thank the gods up above. #Blessed

Oh dang, here comes Minerva all eager and fast,
Darting down from Olympus, her mission unsurpassed.
She's ready to bring about something really great,
Like a boss on a mission, she won't even hesitate.

She's like the Queen B, ruling her heavenly throne,
With her goddess powers, she's not one to moan.
Minerva's got it all, brains and beauty galore,
And she's ready to show what she's truly got in store. 

So watch out mortals, she's coming for you all,
Bringing wisdom and knowledge like a boss, tall and small.
Her impact will be felt far and wide,
Just like the Drake meme, she won't be denied.

Oh snap, Ulysses got a plan to stop the foes,
He said, "Go check if they're getting close."
Dolius's son did what he was told,
And soon enough, he saw the foes unfold.

He rushed back in and said to Ulysses,
"Here they come, let's gear up with finesse."
So they put on their armour ready to fight,
Hoping to win with all their might.

Ulysses was wise, he knew what to do,
He gathered his men, strong and true.
They fought with courage, they fought with fire,
Ulysses' plan was their great desire.

In the end, they won the fight with pride,
And Dolius's sons stood side by side.
Ulysses' leadership led them to success,
This story of victory is truly blessed.

Yo, Ulysses and his crew,
Gearin' up for battle, it's what they gotta do.
Laertes and Dolius, grey hair don't care,
They're warriors now, ready to square.

They don their armour at lightning speed,
Like superheroes, they're ready to lead.
Six sons of Dolius, Ulysses and friends,
Warriors together, the fight never ends.

They open the gate, they sally forth,
Ready to conquer, victory's their worth.
Ulysses leads the way, he's got the nave,
Together they'll fight, until they're saved. 

It's lit, it's lit, the battle's on,
Millennials in armour, they're never gone.
They'll fight until the job is done,
Internet slaying, they're having fun.

Yo Telemachus, check out who's here!
Mentor's voice and form is what's near,
Jove's daughter Minerva in disguise,
Ready to offer guidance and advise.

Ulysses is pumped, happy to see,
He tells his son, filled with glee,
"A fight is coming, don't forget,
Your ancestors were tough, don't let
Them down, show your mettle and might,
Fight with all your strength and fight right."

Yo, Telemachus is straight flexin',
he ain't tryna disgrace his family, no vexin',
his dad's words are wise, truly spoken,
and to prove him right, teachin' ain't just token.

Telemachus gonna show his worth,
no fakin', no frontin', since birth,
he'll make his pops proud, that's for sure,
'cause Telemachus is not afraid to endure.

His dad's teachings will not be in vain,
he won't drown his sorrows in champagne,
Telemachus is ready to fight,
like he's powered by a Fortnite light.

So watch out world, here he comes,
Telemachus ain't no zero, he's number one,
he'll make a name for himself, just you see,
just like when y'all go viral with a new meme.

Oh my days, Laertes is on cloud nine,
He's had a stroke of luck that's divine,
His son and grandson are both super fine,
Competing in bravery, it's quite a goldmine.

Laertes must be feeling so fly,
Like a boss, and he doesn't know why,
But he's hyped up and ready to try,
Bringing positivity, no room for a sigh.

He's thinking, wow, so epic,
My fam knows how to be fantastic,
It's almost like they're incredibly elastic,
Bouncing back strong, never to be drastic.

In the words of Drake, they started from the bottom,
Now they're here, and it's hard to top 'em,
And the best part of all, we can't just stop 'em,
They're shining bright, like diamonds, on 'em.

So let's clap it up for Laertes and his team,
They're living out the dream, or so it seems,
And if anyone disagrees, they can hear Laertes scream,
"I got 99 problems, but a brave family ain't one", extreme!

Oh, Minerva, goddess of prowess and might,
Guide our hero to aim with all his might,
Poseidon's son stands before him,
But with your help, victory won't be dim.

"Son of Arceisius," Minerva spoke,
With my help, defeat him with one poke,
The blue-eyed damsel and Jove aid you,
It's time to show what you can do.

Poise your spear, ready your arm,
With this throw, we cause great harm,
Let it fly like a swift bird,
And show this foe you won't be deterred.

As you hurl that spear with might,
Let's hope it lands just right,
For as we all know, as the meme goes,
Aim for the head, and watch him decompose.

Ulysses was hyped, his spirits were high
He felt like he could take on any guy
The goddess Minerva filled him with vigor
And he sent his spear flying to trigger

It hit Eupeithes' helmet, pierced it right through
His armor clattered off as he fell askew
Telemachus and his dad continued the fight
With swords and spears, every move just right

They could have killed every enemy there
Stopped them from leaving with nary a care
But Minerva intervened, and made it clear
The time had come to stop without any fear.

Oh my lit fam, what a fright they drew,
At the voice of the goddess that they knew,
Their arms so scared, they fell on the ground,
And off to the city, they all did bound.

But Ulysses, oh he was so brave,
Like an eagle soaring, he did crave,
The son of Saturn then sent a bolt of fire,
Minerva said, "Stop, for Jove will be irate, Sire."

Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you see,
Must heed Minerva's call urgently,
Or else he'll make the mighty Jove angry,
And that's a fate too fearful to warrant a plea.

So Ulysses, oh great hero of the land,
He stopped the warful strife so grand,
And saved his men from further harm,
Thanks to Minerva's warning charm. 

#NoHashtags #LitFam #RhymeTime #Minerva #Ulysses #TheOdyssey

Yo, Minerva was like "Ulysses, listen please!"
And without hesitation, he fell to his knees.
She turned into Mentor, her voice so serene,
Creating peace between parties, she's not mean.

Mentor made a deal for them to reach,
And both groups promised to cease and desist each.
Peaceful souls we've got here, that's for sure,
Thanks to Minerva's guidance and Mentor's allure.
