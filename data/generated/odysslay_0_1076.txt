BOOK I

Listen up, fam, to this epic tale, 
Of a fly protagonist who didn't fail. 
He roamed around the globe, traveled far and wide, 
After defeating Troy, he had no place to hide. 

He saw many cities, and learned diverse customs, 
He suffered on the sea, with storms and tempests. 
Despite his attempts, he couldn't save his crew, 
Those silly sailors met their own doom, that is true. 

They ate the cattle of the Sun-god, oh no! 
Which prevented them from returning home, yo. 
Tell us, daughter of Jove, and spill the tea, 
From whatever source you know, girl, we're all ears, you see.

Listen up, fam, let me tell you 'bout Ulysses,
He's been through it all, avoided death and diseases.
He longed to see his wife again and go back to his throne,
But Calypso had him trapped in her home zone.

Years passed by, but the gods didn't forget,
It was finally time for Ulysses to jet-set.
But even in Ithaca, his troubles didn't end,
Neptune was still hating and wouldn't be his friend.

The gods had pity, they felt his pain,
But Neptune was still holding a grudge, it's insane!
Ulysses just wanted to see his queen,
But Neptune's anger made the journey obscene.

This hero's journey wasn't easy, we know,
But with perseverance, he'll overcome every foe.
Stay strong like Ulysses, don't give up hope,
And you'll make it to the top of the slope.

Yo gods, it's time to convene,
Olympus vibe check, let's convene.
Neptune's partying with the Ethiopians,
Chilling with a hecatomb of sheep and oxen.
But let's talk about Aegisthus' fate,
That dude was slayed by Orestes, no debate.
So what's our plan, how should we proceed,
To make sure justice has been achieved?

Yo, yo, yo just listen to Zeus's words flow,
He says men blame gods when they don't know,
Like Aegisthus, who thought he was hot stuff,
Tried to get with Agamemnon's wife and it got rough.

Despite Mercury's warning, the dude didn't give a care,
And now he's dead, man, Orestes got his fair share,
Zeus gave this warning out of pure kindness,
But Aegisthus ignored it, and now he's gone blindless. 

So let's not play the blame game with the divine,
Sometimes humans mess up, it's just time to shine,
And remember to always listen to advice that's true,
Or else we'll end up like Aegisthus too. #RIP #ListenToAdvice #GodsKnowBest

"Yo, Minerva, you're right on the spot
Ulysses has gone through a lot
On a lonely island, without his bros
Tired of life, longing for his own abode 

A goddess lives there, daughter of Atlas
Her charms are something he can't outlast
She's trying to make him forget his home
But Ulysses can't stop, will never succumb 

Oh, Zeus, hear my plea, what's up with the hate?
Remember the sacrifices he did to propitiate
Let go of your wrath, give him a break
It's time to end this salty lake"

Yo, Jove!

Did you forget about Ulysses, the Capable Man?

The one who's always sacrificing, doing what he can?

I know Neptune's mad he made Polyphemus blind,

But keeping him from home seems a little unkind.

Let's come together, brainstorm some dope plans,

With all of us united, Neptune won't stand a chance.

We'll get Ulysses back, no need to fear,

And maybe even drop some offerings at his feet, with cheer.

Like, Minerva was all, "Zeus's spawn, mighty ruler of all, if the gods wanna get Ulysses home, we need to give Calypso a phone call. But first, lemme head to Ithaca and give Telemachus a hype, so he can call a meeting and speak out against Penelope's unfaithful griping gripe. Those suitors be eating our boy's sheep and cattle, but we'll send them packing like Seattle without a title! We'll go to Sparta and Pylos to hear if there's any news, about the arrival of Ulysses, and maybe some island booze."

Hold up, let me tell you a tale,
'Bout a goddess that flew without fail.
Athena with her flashy kicks on,
Zoomed down to earth in a flash - gone!

Wielding her spear that's heavy-duty,
Fierce and fierce, so strong and mighty.
She landed in Odysseus' town,
Disguised as Mentes, lookin' around.

Inside the house, the suitors cozied,
Playing games, quite uncomposed and frozen.
The servants were busy, pristine and neat,
Tables cleaned up, meat cut into little bits to eat.

Goddess Athena, she was quick to act,
Ready to bring these suitors back.
Stay tuned to see how she does it,
I promise this story won't make you spit!

Telemachus was chilling with the crew
Thinking 'bout his dad and what he'd do
He saw Minerva and thought "oh shoot"
Didn't want her waiting, looking cute
He took her hand and asked for her spear
"Welcome to our crib, we got noms here"
After you've eaten, let us know
Why you're here, what's the flow?

As he walked and talked, Minerva came along,
He took her spear and placed it in a throng,
Of spears, which belonged to his sorrowful father,
And led her to a seat, grander than any other.

With a cloth of damask, he covered her chair,
And provided a footstool for her feet to bear,
The noise of suitors he kept far away,
So she could eat in peace and he could say:

"More about my father I need to know,
Share with me goddess, don't be slow,
Their insolence won't irritate you here,
Tell me the truth, don't let your words disappear." 

The atmosphere was peaceful, and Minerva was glad,
She told him the truth without being sad,
And as they talked, the suitors grew angry,
But Telemachus didn't care, he only felt tangy.

For he had found answers to what he sought,
Thanks to Minerva who helped him a lot,
And he knew that he was on the right track,
For he won't let his father's killers come back.

The story gets even better, let me spit some facts,
They were served on gold plates, and drank from gold cups without any lacks,
The maid, the servant, the carver, the upper,
All brought the fire, we love to see them show their power.

Their water was served in a golden ewer and silver basin,
I'm beyond shook, let me tell you that for certain,
The carver did them justice with all manner of meat,
I wish I was there, those plates must have looked real neat.

And let's not forget about the wine that was poured,
By a man-servant, who knew how to keep it stored,
I would give anything to party with these guys,
Raise a glass and say cheers, until the sun starts to rise.

Yo, the suitors are here, taking their seats,
Men servants pour water, maids with bread like it's beats.
Pages fill mixing bowls, let the wine flow,
Hands on the good things, let's go with the flow.
Eating and drinking, they want more,
Music and dancing, like never before.
A servant brought a lyre, to Phemius' delight,
And the suitors compelled him to sing with all their might.
As soon as he begins, Telemachus whispers low,
To Minerva, so no man can hear, don't you know.

Yo dude, don't get mad, but I gotta hype this chat.
Singing's dope, but not if it's at the cost of a dead man's bat.
If these dudes saw your dad, they'd wish for longer legs.
Money ain't what they want, they just care about their kegs.
But, alas, your dad's fate was cruel and grim.
Folks say he's coming back, but we know that's slim.
Bro, gimme the deets, who you are is what I seek.
Where ya from? How'd you get here? Spill it! Don't be meek.
What's your crew and ship like, and what's your background be?
Have you been here before, or are you new like a Wii?

Yo, listen up and hear me tell,
a story that I know quite well.
Mentes is the name I bear,
King of Taphians without a care.

My ship and crew, we set to sail,
To Temesa with cargo and mail.
Iron we bring and copper we take,
While we navigate sea and lake.

My ship is docked in that harbor yonder,
Near the mountain with trees asunder.
Our fathers were friends, like buds on a tree,
Old Laertes knows, just ask and you'll see.

They tell me, your dad's not in this town,
But instead kept from you by a heavenly crown.
He's not dead yet or trapped on land,
Somewhere, he must be or in a foreign band.

I'm no prophet, but hear me out,
Ulysses will return, there's no doubt.
He's a man of resourceful might,
Chains can't hold him, he'll take flight.

Now, tell me true, my curious fella,
Can Ulysses have a boy that's so hella?
You look like him, no doubt at all,
Both Argives, both standing tall.

Since Troy fell, for ages long,
Neither have seen each other gone.
But here we are, face to face,
And maybe soon, in the same place.

Yo, my dude Telemachus in the house,
Wishing for a dad who's not stuck like a mouse,
His mother says his pops is the mighty Ulysses,
But he's not sure who that is and he confesses.

He wishes for a dad with a simpler life,
Someone who's not always stuck in strife,
Being a son of Ulysses is tough,
His dad's reputation is just too rough.

Telemachus longs for a family like his friends,
One that's not brimming with endless trends,
He wants a dad who's always there,
Not one who's always on a dare.

But who knows, maybe things will change,
And his father's love will be in range,
Until then, our boy's feeling blue,
Just like the meme says, "Feels bad, man," it's true.

Yo, Minerva my girl, don't you know?
Telemachus' swag is off the charts, yo!
As for the feast, it's lit, it's live,
The homies came to party and thrive.

No wedding bells or food for show,
Those guests came to drink and go with the flow,
But you're right, they actin' like fools,
Disrespecting the house and breaking the rules.

Telemachus knows it's not cool,
But he's gotta keep his cool, he's no fool,
He needs to find his pa,
Who's been gone for way too long, raw.

So don't stress, Minerva my queen,
Telemachus is focused, he's not mean,
He'll handle these guests with class,
And find his father, he'll kick ass!

"Bro," said Telmachus, "let me explain,
My dad's disappearance caused us all pain.
The gods, in their wrath, made him vanish real quick,
Without leaving a trace, it makes me feel sick.
If he had died in Troy, it would've been okay,
And his fame would have lived on every day.
But now it's all lost, I inherit dismay,
And I don't know how to fix it, what can I say?
But wait, there's more, my house is a mess,
People eating my food without any finesse.
The chiefs from all islands, they're causing distress,
My mother won't marry, but won't say no unless.
They're taking my stuff, ruining my life,
It's all getting too much, causing strife."

Oh dang, so you're telling me, 
Ulysses needs his gear, his weaponry. 
If he's still the same guy I used to know, 
He'll take down those suitors, he'll put on a show.
Back then, he headed to Ephyra, 
Begged Ilus for poison to make his arrows fly higher. 
Ilus didn't want to mess with the gods above, 
But my dad gave Ulysses some, he had much love.
If he's as great as before, those suitors won't last, 
Their wedding plans are doomed, it's a thing of the past.

Lit fam, heaven decides if he'll go back,
And take revenge on the suitors who lack.
But trust me, you gotta act fast,
Call an assembly and lay it out in contrast.

Let the Achaean heroes know your pain,
And bid the suitors to leave their vain.
If your mom wants to get hitched again,
Send her back to her father, let him entertain.

You, sir, must gather a crew,
Of twenty men, and set sail anew.
In search of your long-lost dad,
Who may be alive, you'll be glad.

Go to Pylos, ask Nestor first,
Then hit up Sparta, quench that thirst.
If dad's alive, deal with those suitors,
For another year, they'll have to be troopers.

But if he's dead, come home and bury,
And build a barrow, don't worry.
Then think of ways to kill the suitors,
Make a name for yourself in future rumors.

You're no baby, can't play that card,
Remember Orestes, praise was his award.
So, go and kill those suitors in your own house,
Impress your kin and be feared by your spouse.

I gotta go, my crew's waiting,
But think over what I'm stating.
Take care and good luck to you,
May the gods help you all the way through.

Yo, Telemachus, you're hella chill,
Treating me like your pops, it's a thrill.
You're kind to tell me all you know,
And I'll hear more before I go.

But wait a sec, don't bounce so fast,
Refresh yo'self, it'll be a blast.
Take a bath, relax and chill,
I'll give you a gift that's ill.

So listen up, my dear friend,
This present's off the charts 'till the end.
It's beauty and value ain't no joke,
A keepsake that'll leave ya stoked.

Yo Minerva, you're a goddess no doubt, 
On your way out, of this place you flout, 
Don't keep her here, she needs to depart, 
But keep the present, till she's back at the start.

You know this girl, she's got some class, 
So give her presents that will surpass, 
Her expectations, give something great, 
And in return, she'll appreciate.

She's a legend, she's so divine,
Her presence here, such a sign,
So give her something, to make her stay, 
And she'll give back in every way.

Oh dang, Telemachus is on a roll,  
Feeling brave and in control.  
He saw a god, some may call it fate,  
And now he's marching towards the haters' gate. 

The suitors were chilling, eating and drinking,  
Their party was loud, but soon they'd be shrinking.  
Telemachus walked in, looking hella fly,  
Showing off his newfound strength and his battle cry. 

The suitors were shook, they didn't know what to do,  
They never expected this dude to come through.  
Telemachus stood tall, with his head held high,  
And he said, "You'll all pay for making my household cry!" 

The suitors were weak, but they tried to fight back,  
Don't they know Telemachus is on the right track?  
He's got the gods on his side, and now he's got guts,  
With his mentor Athena and his pops up above. 

Telemachus is a boss, he won't back down,  
The suitors better run or they'll be put down.  
Thanks to the goddess, his courage now bloomed,  
And he'll show those losers he can't be outdoomed.

Yo, Phemius spittin' bars, 
Tales of Troy straight from the stars, 
Penelope hearin', tears in her eyes, 
Her handmaids steady as they realize. 

She comes down the stairs with grace, 
Surrounded by beauty, full of grace, 
Veil on her face, hidin' her tears, 
Upset by the song and all its fears. 

The suitors watch as she makes her way, 
One bearing post, she stands to say, 
Why bring sorrow to my heart so true, 
Icarius' daughter, at a loss to do. 

Phemius droppin' rhymes and beats, 
Penelope hearin', feelin' the heat, 
Her heart is shattered, her soul torn apart, 
As the melody lingers in her heart. 

She weeps for the Achaeans and their fate, 
Her tears dropping like a heavy weight, 
But her spirit's strong, she won't back down, 
Filled with determination, she wears her crown.

Yo Phemius, stop with that depressing scheme
Instead, spit some fire 'bout some lit godly dream
Tell the suitors 'bout some epic quest
And let them drink and vibe, feeling their best

Your tales of sorrow only make me blue
Reminding me of my lost dude, who
Was loved by all in middle Argos
His name reaching heights of venerated cosmos

But don't forget, we need some lituation
A story that sparks joy, not consternation
So come on, Phemius, let's hear your flow
Take us to a world where legends grow

Like the Greek gods that reign supreme
A tale that's dope, a story we can dream
So crack open that bottle and let's get lit
Phemius, you got this, go on and spit!

Oh, snap, Telemachus was getting heated,
His mom didn't like the bard's tune, but he repeated,
"Chill, ma, the bards don't create the chaos they sing,
It's all about the big guy, Jove, doing his thing."

Telemachus was real smooth, no need to fuss,
He knew that people dug the latest songs, like it's a must,
So don't worry, ma, just accept the news,
Ulysses ain't the only one who didn't get to choose.

Head back inside and do what you do,
The loom and distaff and running the crew,
Because talking's for men, that's what he said,
Especially for him, master here, in charge ahead.

Oh dang, Penelope's heart is aching
Her son's words, in her mind, constantly shaking
Her husband, gone for so long
Her tears fall, like a sad love song

Upstairs, she weeps with her girls
Mourning her loss, in a sad swirl
But Minerva, the goddess, brings relief
And Penelope sleeps, with a sense of belief

Meanwhile, the suitors make lots of noise
Trying to get Penelope, the ultimate prize
They beg and plead, for a chance to be with her
But little do they know, that Penelope's heart is a blur.

"Yo Telemachus, your words are on point,
But these suitors ain't got no joint,
Feasting and acting so lavish,
But can't even leave, that's straight savage.

Phemius' voice is divine, it's true,
But what's with this squabbling, boo-hoo?
Tomorrow in the morning, full assembly planned,
So get outta here, that's the command.

Turn and turn about, feast at your own cost,
Otherwise, Jove's reckoning, there'll be a high cost,
If you fall in my father's house, no one to save,
So hop to it, and leave, no need to misbehave."

Oh snap, Antinous, don't you see,
This dude's got a gift, listen to me!
His speech is bold, his confidence high,
Don't hate on him just 'cause you can't even try.

You talk about gods, but have no chill,
You should take some lessons, maybe pop a pill.
This guy's got swag, he's got the moves,
Don't be jelly, it won't improve.

His dad was chief, that's for sure,
But this dude's got skills, you can't ignore.
So don't be hating, just give him a chance,
He might surprise you with his stance. 

#SorryNotSorry #HatersGonnaHate #SwaggyMcSwagger

Antinous, bro, stop hating on me
I'll be chief, just wait and see 
Is that really the worst you can do? 
Being chief brings riches and honour too 

Yeah, Ulysses is gone, that's true 
But Ithaca has many great men, not just a few 
I may not lead them all, that's fine 
But in my own house, I'll be the one to shine 

The people Ulysses won for me 
Will be mine to rule, just you wait and see 
So don't trip, don't worry, don't stress 
I'll hold it down, I'll be the best 

*drops mic*

Eury! You're up with your words so sly!
It's not up to you to decide who's the guy,
But we'll listen to you, Odysseus, dude so fly,
You're the master of your own house, that ain't a lie!

This stranger that we see, tell us about his game,
Where does he come from? What is his fame?
Is he here to make some quick dough or name?
Did you hear news from him? Or is he just a solid frame?

He seemed rich 'n' all, but he was quick to bounce,
Before we could figure his deal and pronounce,
So Odysseus, man, won't you give us the ounce,
'Bout this stranger who left us in a hurry and pounce?

Yo, my dude Telemachus spittin' facts,
His pops is gone, and he ain't goin' back.
Mama's checkin' with a soothsayer,
But Telemachus ain't got time for that player.

He met a stranger named Mentes,
Son of Anchialus, chief of Taphians.
He seemed familiar, but he couldn't place it,
In his heart, he knew it was the goddess.
 
Telemachus ain't trustin' rumors no more,
He's ready to even the score,
If anyone's been messin' with his fam,
He'll make 'em pay, oh damn. 

But for now, he's just chillin' with Mentes,
Ponderin' about the gods and their intents.
Greece ain't ready for this young king's rise,
He's gonna make 'em all reprise. 

#Nohashtags #Rhyminggamestrong #Telemachuskeepingitreal

Telemachus was chillin' in his tower,
Brooding and thinking hour by hour,
With Euryclea, by his side,
He had nothing to hide.

She held the torch high and lit the way,
As Telemachus had much to say,
Laertes' son was in deep thought,
While the old woman's care had him caught.

He sat on the bed, took off his shirt,
And handed it to her without any hurt,
She hung it nicely, he laid down,
Thinking of his journey, with a little frown.

The advice of the goddess, Minerva in his head,
Knowing what he must do instead,
All night long he kept on thinking,
As his mind was quickly shrinking.

Aight, check it out, let me tell you a tale
That's gonna be hype, it's gonna prevail
It's got memes, slang, and all that jazz
It's gonna be fire, no need for pizzazz

The story starts with a queen, a true boss
She ran the game, she was never at a loss
Her drip was tight, her fit was clean
She was the queen of the scene, if you know what I mean

But then one day, some drama went down
Her haters came out, they tried to take the crown
But she wasn't phased, she stood her ground
And in the end, she snatched that crown without a sound

The haters were shook and they knew they lost
They couldn't handle the queen, at any cost
She slayed with grace, she slayed with might
She showed them all what it means to be tight

So now the queen reigns supreme
She's got the throne, she's living the dream
Her story's lit, it's one for the ages
And you know what? It's got all the rage-ous.

BOOK II

Telemachus be lookin' like a god, no lie,
Fly kicks, sword shinin', he's catchin' the eye.
He calls his homies with the criers' sound,
And they gather round in the meeting ground.

Two hounds by his side, he walks with swag,
The way he looks, it makes the people gag.
Minerva's gift, a presence so divine,
That even old councillors make way like they're in line.

In his father's seat, he takes his rightful place,
Everyone's lookin', they can't keep their gaze.
Telemachus, young and bold,
Ready to hear what the people hold.

He's not just a boy, he's not just a man,
He's got the charm that only gods can.
Telemachus, smart and slick,
He could lead an army, do it quick!

No wonder Minerva blessed him right,
Telemachus would put up a good fight.
He's got it all, style and grace,
Telemachus, he's holdin' the ace.

Yo, listen up, this is a tale 'bout Aegyptius,
Old school guy, but his words are never bogus.
He'd been around the block, with infinite experience,
But his heart was still shattered with immense grievance.

His son Antiphus went with Ulysses to Ilius,
With noble horses and warriors who weren't clueless.
But Cyclops got them all in a cave locked,
Poor Antiphus, by the Cyclops was cooked.

Three sons he had, but only one was a suitor,
Eurynomus, who Aegyptius thought was a hater.
The other two worked hard for their dad,
While he couldn't get over Antiphus being dead.

Aegyptius� heart was still filled with sorrow,
For the loss of his son today and tomorrow.
But he spoke with wisdom, in spite of his pain,
And forever he will remember his lost son's name.

Hey all you men of Ithaca, let's hear it out
It's been so long since we had a council meet about
Who's this guy trying to call us together, no doubt?
Is he warning us of danger or got some other clout?
He seems like a solid dude, hope he gets good clout
May Jove bless his desires, no naysayers to flout.

Yo, Telemachus took the speech,
As a signal to speak to the whole reach.
He gathered everyone around,
And his coolness could be easily found.

The good herald Pisenor brought his staff,
And Telemachus was ready to laugh,
"Not warning of any hater,
But I'm aggrieved, it's a personal matter."

He said, "The loss of my father is the first,
And it's the second that is the worst.
My mother's suitors are a pain,
Ruining our estate, it's not a gain.

The chief men's sons are in my house,
Marrying my mom like it's a mouse,
Afraid to ask my grandpa for bride,
Every day, I can't hide.

Sacrificing our oxen, sheep,
Drinking wine like it's a treat,
Our estate will be in ruins,
No more Ulysses for the actions of these goons.

I can't stand this any longer,
I used to be stronger,
House disgraced and ruined,
You can't keep us dampened.

So, don't leave me singlehanded,
Or my brave father, who you once demanded,
Did he do wrong to the Achaeans in the past,
That you would make me eat it at last?

If you eat out of house and home,
I'd rather you get eaten to the bone,
So I can take action to the extreme,
And won't have just to dream."

By Jove and Themis, he made his case,
Hoping they won't leave it like usual, without any trace.
Telemachus poised and ready,
Like cup noodles, always steady.

Telemachus poured his heart out, his sadness so loud,
His staff hit the ground, tears wetting the crowd.
Everyone felt for him, but stayed quiet still,
Except Antinous, who just had to be shrill.

"Bro, why all the tears? You're being so extra,
Can't you see we're chillin', with no need for this nectar?"
Telemachus felt anger, he was about to snap,
But he breathed and composed himself like a true rap.

"Antinous, you're just a hater, always bringing drama,
Can't you see I'm struggling, you're just adding trauma?
But mark my words, I won't let you bring me down,
I'll find my father, and bring justice to this town."

The room fell silent, as Telemachus spoke with power,
Antinous stood defeated, his ego lost in the hour.
From this moment on, Telemachus showed his true grit,
A hero in the making, who won't ever quit.

Oh snap, Telemachus should definitely have a seat
He's out here pointing fingers, placing all the blame on our feet
Saying it's the suitors' fault, but let me tell you this,
It's your mom who's the real mastermind, making us all miss

For three years now, and almost reaching four,
She's had us going crazy, knocking at her door
Playing mind games, sending mixed messages,
Making us believe she's down for some courtly marriages

And let's not forget her needlework, so intricate and grand
Trying to make us wait for love, she's got us caught up in her plan
Crafting a pall for Laertes, sweat dripping from her brow,
She wants him to have a rich burial, with women gossiping "wow"

So don't come at us, Telemachus, with all your insolence,
Your mom's got skills, she's the one who's been making all this sense
Now let's all just chill, take a break and exhale,
And see where this Odyssey story goes, as we set sail. 

#NoHashtags #NotYoUsualText #LitRhymes

Okay, listen up, y'all, I got a story to tell,  
Bout a woman who knew magic, spun a web pretty well.  
She fooled everyone for three years, a real sly trick,  
Workin' all day, unpickin' at night with her torch lit.  

But in the fourth year, one maid spilled the tea,  
Told her captors what was up, set the truth free.  
They caught her red-handed, and said, "enough's enough,  
Mama's gotta go, find a husband, that's the tough stuff."  

These suitors couldn't handle her smarts and her skill,  
Her airs and accomplishments makin' them ill.  
They wanted her gone so they could have some peace,  
Their gluttony hurtin' her son's estate, sheesh.  

They'd heard of legendary women, Tyro and such,  
But Mama was the real deal, they couldn't keep up.  
They wouldn't leave until Mama said, "I do,"  
Heard enough of her excuses, they wanted someone who  

Wouldn't toy with their hearts, or mess with their minds,  
Someone who'd submit and be less hard to find.  
So that's the story, folks, of Mama the Queen,  
Pretending to weave, but really causing a scene.

Antinous, dude, what's your deal?
Don't you know how I feel?
My dad's gone, we don't know where
My heart's heavy but you just don't care

I can't send my mom away 
and it's not something I can just say 
If I do, I'll have to pay
And I'll regret it every day

Icarius wants a hefty sum
If we send his daughter home,
It's not just that, it's also dumb
And my conscience will forever moan

If you're mad, just leave instead
Go feast elsewhere, break bread
But if you keep being a freeloader
Jove will be your debtor, shoulder to shoulder

In my father's house, you won't stand
No one will avenge you, I won't lend a hand
So think twice before you sponge
On the hospitality that's already been avenged.

Yo, peeps, let me tell you 'bout a vision,
Jove sent two eagles, not just a revision.
They flew with the wind, side by side,
Sailing like bosses, oh what a ride!

As they reached the assembly, they wheeled and circled,
Beating their wings, their eyes glaring, oh how they sparkled!
They fought fiercely, tearing one another apart,
Then flew off towards the town, like a work of art.

People wondered, what could this mean?
Halitherses spoke up, like a prophetic machine.
He said, "Listen up, I speak honesty,
This vision is a message, can't you see?"

These eagles represent a powerful force,
Two sides fighting, a conflict of course.
They'll bring death and destruction, no doubt,
So let's prepare, before chaos breaks out."

Yo, dudes of Ithaca, let me spit some truth
This warning is mainly for the sleuths;
There's trouble brewing and it's not mild,
Ulysses is coming back to execute his style.

He'll rain down chaos, don't think he's bluffin',
Not just on the suitors, but on all of us nothin's,
We need to act fast and smart, before things get rough,
Otherwise, we'll experience some pretty gnarly stuff.

The suitors should stop this shit on their own,
Otherwise, they'll end up burying their bones,
I'm not just talkin' without reason,
I predicted Ulysses' fate before he left, so hear me, son.

I said that he'd lose all his men and face pain,
And then, after twenty years, he'd return to his domain,
But nobody would recognize him, his face obscured,
And now it's all happening as I foresaw, you heard?

So heed my wise words and stop the madness,
Or face the wrath of this hero's badassness.

Hold up, Grandpa, what's with the fuss?
Your omen skills are weak, never trust a bird to discuss.
Ulysses is gone, no need to weep,
But you need to chill, your words are too deep.

Trying to rile up Telemachus with your speech,
But we won't let you teach.
Your words are just a game,
We see through you like it's nothing but lame.

I mean, come on, seriously,
You think you know more than us so clearly?
We won't pay, we'll just keep eating,
Telemachus's food we'll be beating.

Your advice, we won't heed,
Our girl Penelope is all we need.
We'll stay and make ourselves at home while we can,
But honestly, you should leave, man.

Go home, old-timer, and take a nap,
'Cause right now, you're just a trap.
Don't try to play us like you're the boss,
We see through you like a transparent gloss.

So go on, go back to your fam,
We're all good here, ya hearin' the jam?
And if you decide to stay and linger,
We'll just have to take your finger. (LOL just kidding)

Oh snap, you hear that, suitors and crew? 
Telemachus is not playing, he's not pulling a boo-hoo. 
He's got some serious business to attend, 
Trying to find the man he calls his friend. 

He needs a ship and some of you to steer, 
Twenty strong men, to find his daddy dear. 
He'll go to Sparta and Pylos too, 
Searching everywhere, just to find a clue. 

Maybe he'll hear something, or get a sign, 
Letting him know where his dad might dine. 
If he's alive and on his way back, 
Telemachus will let you all continue to pack. 

But if he's dead and gone forever, 
Telemachus will mourn, no doubt, whatever. 
He'll bury his father with utmost prestige, 
And make his mom happy, that's for sure, he'll besiege.

Yo! It's time to hear what's up from Mentor,
He's got the truth, he's not a dissenter.
As Ulysses' friend, he's got full authority,
So let's hear him out, and feel the solidarity.

He spoke with honesty, no need to lie,
Here's the 411, so don't be shy.
Mentor's got the tea, so listen up tight,
And don't let his words slip out of sight.

He said, Ulysses is gone and won't be coming back,
But don't worry y'all, we won't fall off track.
We'll hold down the fort and do what we can,
Until Ulysses returns, with his master plan. 

So, let's stay strong and hold our heads up high,
We've got this fam, no need to cry.
Mentor's got our back, let's be clear,
And with his guidance, we'll overcome our fear. 

Keep calm and carry on, is what Mentor would say,
We'll keep the house running, come what may.
So listen up now, he's done with his story,
Let's keep the faith, and keep up the glory.

Y'all hear me out, men of Ithaca town,
Your rulers are just a big-time letdown,
I hope you get rulers, who are cruel and despotic,
Who'll destroy your city, be totally chaotic.

Every single chief you choose,
Make 'em unjust, who'll make us lose.
Ulysses was the one who led,
Like a father, he had us fed.

I ain't mad at the suitors, they have every right,
But you guys are weak, can't put up a fight.
Scandalous behavior, you should stop it,
You could do it, gather and plot it.

Hold up, hold up, what is this rhyming ruckus?
Mentor, why you tryna make a scene, you can't bust us.
One man against many, that's just insane,
Ulysses himself wouldn't try to be so vain.

His wife's waiting for him, can't you see the situation?
If he fought us now, it'd be his own damnation.
So go on people, do what you gotta do,
Let's let Mentor and Halitherses see this boy through.

But let's be real, will he even make the trip?
He's more likely to stay put and give us all the slip.
So let's not get too worked up over nothing,
And let the boy decide if he wants to get running.

Oh snap, the assembly's adjourned
Everyone went home, no one too concerned 
Suitors, on the other hand, went to Ulysses' place
Thinking they could win Penelope's heart in a chase

But little did they know, Our man Ulysses was just in disguise
Ready to give them a surprise 
He'll come back and show them who's the boss
Leaving them all at a big loss

No more games, no more chasing
Those suitors need to start facing
The wrath of Ulysses, the man himself
Who's been away for years, getting help from a helpful elf.

Yo, Telemachus be feeling all-alone,
By the sea, he's thinking on his own,
Washing his hands in the grey waves,
Praying to Minerva, hoping she saves.

He be asking for guidance and power,
In this desperate, lonely hour,
He's hoping Minerva hears his plea,
And helps him unlock his true destiny.

Telemachus seeking divine intervention,
Like when you ask for likes on social media attention,
His devotion and faith is unwavering,
Like a meme going viral, forever spreading.

With his hands in the water and sand,
Telemachus puts his future in Minerva's hand,
Hoping she can be his guiding light,
Like a trending hashtag shining bright.

"Hold up, fam, I gotta speak my mind,
Zeus came through and gave me a sign,
To find my dad who's been gone so long,
But these suitors got me feeling so wrong.

They always tryna block my way,
Like, why you gotta act that way?
But I know I gotta keep my head high,
And listen to the man up in the sky.

So watch out suitors, I'm on a mission,
And I won't stop until I complete my mission,
Zeus gave me the go, so you better hide,
'Cause I'm coming through like a swift low-ride.

I gotta find my dad and bring him home,
No matter where he's been or where he's roamed,
So Zeus, hear me out, I'm on my way,
To bring my dad back home, hip hip hooray!"

Yo, Telemachus, hear me out,  
You gotta show what you're about.  
Minerva's here to give some aid,  
As Mentor, all her help displayed.  

Your father, he was wise and strong,  
And never did his duty wrong.  
If you're made of the same kind,  
Your voyage won't be left behind.  

But if you lack his courage, friend,  
Then success seems far from the end.  
Sons, they're never like their dads,  
But don't you fret, don't you be sad.  

Don't join those suitors, foolish lot,  
Who care for naught and want you not.  
Death and doom soon will befall,  
On each and every one of them all.  

Now listen up, it won't be long,  
You'll be packing your bags and gone.  
Get everything in order, quick,  
Wine in jars and barley thick.  

I'll find a ship, she'll be the best,  
And with you, I'll put it to the test.  
I'll gather volunteers to help,  
You'll thank me later for sitting kelp.  

So go ahead and head back home,  
While I go and search and roam.  
We'll meet again, don't you forget,  
We'll sail the sea without regret.  

(Insert meme reference here)

Yo, was Antinous trippin', thinking Telemachus would just stop his mission!
But Telemachus had a plan, with the help of the goddess Minerva he's stopping all opposition.
As he slid up to the party, they were cooking up some meat, Antinous came at him with a laugh and handshake, thinking he'd just take a seat.
But Telemachus was all business, he wasn't about to chill, he wanted to know about his father's whereabouts, and he won't stop until he fulfills. 
Antinous offered him a crew and a boat, thinking it's what he wanted most, 
But little did he know, Telemachus was about to roast.
He took the offer but planned to use it for his own gain, meeting new people, gaining allies, and not allowing opposition to remain.

Telemachus, bro, listen to my spiel
Your haters be trippin' and it's real
These suitors be hatin' on your wealth
But you got good health, and courage as well

They wasted your property, how dare they
But you ain't gonna take it, not today
You're older and wiser, and that's legit
You know your strength, and you won't submit

You're gonna do 'em harm, oh yeah, no doubt
Whether here with these people or goin' down south
Pylos is where you're headed, it's true
And those suitors better watch their rear view

You may not have a ship, nor a crew
But you're a passenger on a mission, you knew?
Your going won't be in vain, take that to heart
And these haters will finally depart

It's clear this Antinous is a hater, 
Trying to throw shade and stir up some cater.
But Odysseus won't have it, he's too lit, 
He snatches his hand away, doesn't give a sh*t. 

The others are just jealous, trying to clown, 
Taunting and mocking, guess they wanna bring him down. 
But Odysseus stays cool, won't get caught in their trap, 
He's a boss, nothing they say can cause a mishap. 

Dinner's getting ready, they better watch their back, 
Odysseus might come through and put 'em all in check. 
He's a hero for a reason, they shouldn't test his might, 
Or else they'll feel his wrath all through the night. 

So don't mess with the OG, the one and only, 
Odysseus is in the house and he's feeling quite lonely. 
But that's okay, he's got himself and his pride, 
And that's all a lit king needs, just let them all slide.

Oh snap, that's quite the mishap
Telemachus is on the move, better watch your back
Pylos and Sparta, he's got a plan
Maybe even Ephyra, to kill us where we stand

But don't worry fam, we won't let him win
We'll be ready for whatever he brings in
With our squad and our memes, we'll never fall
Telemachus won't get us, no way, not at all

So keep your head up and stay woke
We'll beat Telemachus in one fell stroke
And when we're done, we'll celebrate with some tea
'Cause we're the coolest crew in history!

Yo, did you hear that one dude?
Thinking Telemachus is some sort of food?
Talking 'bout dividing up his cash,
Thinking it's easy, like a game of trash.

But wait a minute, hold up a sec!
Telemachus is no one to disrespect.
He's on a journey to find his lost father,
And that's a journey we shouldn't bother.

With his mother and the man who marries her,
They can have the house, that's just how it occurs.
But Telemachus is more than just wealth,
He's a warrior, a champion, and in his family's health.

So let's not wish him harm or selfish gain,
Let him continue on his brave campaign.
We'll root for him, like a meme going viral,
And hope one day he'll come back with a smile.

"Hey Euryclea, my homey from afar, 
I need your help to inspect this treasure jar.
We need to make sure that our wealth is secure,
And that no thieves have tried to break in for sure. 

Check out the linen and clothes in these chests,
And smell that olive oil, it's one of the best!
But most importantly, our wine must be divine,
Fit for a god, can't let it go past the line. 

These doors are sturdy, to keep everything safe,
And you, Euryclea, are holding down the place.
You're the OG of this house, always on top of it,
Making sure our goods stay fresh and legit."

Yo nurse, pour me the best wine,
The one that's super fine.
Hide some for dad, in case he's alive,
And comes home to revive.

Give me twelve jars, don't be a crook,
And make sure they all have a lid you took.
Pack twenty measures of barley meal,
My trip to Sparta and Pylos I'll seal.

Do this quick and quietly,
No need to mention it to the family.
When night falls and my mom's upstairs,
I'll sneak away with my wares.

Hoping to hear some news,
Of my dad's return and end these blues.

Yo, Euryclea, don't cry, don't you weep,
It's just that his wanderlust runs deep,
Odysseus is the man of the game,
But you think his plan is totally lame.

With his genius, he survived Troy's fall,
But he misses his kingdom, I mean, I get it all,
But home is where your heart's at ease,
And with Penelope he can shoot the breeze.

But hold up, what's this talk about his dad?
He's off to find him, it's so rad,
He left him young, so he feels stuck,
But he knows his pops can bring him some luck.

And you know what they say 'bout blood,
They're thicker than a Mississippi mud,
His father's fate's gotta be unveiled,
And with Athena's help, it won't be failed.

So Euryclea, please don't you cry,
Odysseus isn't meant to die,
He's got a purpose, so let him go,
And hope that one day he'll come back, yo.

Yo nurse, don't fret
My plan's heaven-set
But pinky promise, don't spill a word
'Cuz Mom's tears can't be incurred

For ten to twelve days
Keep this secret in a maze
If Mom catches wind and asks
Then you can spill and remove your mask

Yo, let me tell you bout this lady so cute
She swore a hardcore oath that was really acute
She started pouring that vino in big ol' jars
And the barley meal was bagged up without any scars

While she worked hard, Telemachus strutted in
He sauntered back to the suitors with a confident grin
These suitors were wildin', they were all up in the place
Trying to take his momma while stuffing their face

But Telemachus knew what he had to do
He was ready to fight, his spirit shining through
He would protect his mother from all these lames
And stand up for his fam, 'cause that's just how he games

Oh dang, Minerva's got a plan
She took his shape, she's in command
She hyped up the crew, gave 'em a pep talk
They're off to sail, no time for small talk

Noemon hooked them up with a boat
Everything's set, they're ready to float 
The goddess led them to the end of the dock
Her plan's in motion, like an alarm clock 

When the sun set, they were ready to go
All the gear was packed, their spirits aglow
Minerva's plan- they're on their way
The ship's sailing off without delay 

She kept the crew pumped and hyped
Their eyes set on victory, they'll never lose sight
Minerva's skills, they'll have to suffice
With her leading them, their future is bright 

#notimeforsmalltalk #sailingsquad #settosail #motivationstation #victory #teamworkmakesdreamwork

Oh dang, Athena was on a roll
She went to Ulysses' house, to take control
Her plan to make the suitors drop
Their cups from their hands, was straight-up high on top
Those dudes were fuddled, sleepy, and blurred
Instead of partying, they went back to the herd
Then Athena, aka Mentor, gave a call
To Telemachus, so he didn't stall
It was time to come outside, oh snap!
Athena's plan was like an epic map

Oh, snap, Telemachus, don't be slow,
The guys are ready, don't you know?
They're on board and ready to row,
So hurry up, we've got places to go.

Your orders are what they need,
To set sail and get up to speed.
Don't make them wait or we'll be late,
And that would be a major hate.

So let's go, man, don't be shy,
Time's a-wastin' and we can't lie.
Our journey awaits, we cannot stall,
So give the word and let's give our all. 

And remember, as we hit the sea,
"We're all in this together," just like HSM.

Oh snap, Telemachus is on a quest,
To find his dad and put to rest,
The suitors who have overstayed,
And caused chaos where they laid.

With Athena by his side,
He heads towards the rising tide,
The crew is hyped and ready,
To set sail and keep things steady.

Telemachus gives the command,
To load the stores and take a stand,
Against those who would do them harm,
And cause chaos with their charm.

But wait, his mom is none the wiser,
To the plan that's about to rile her,
Only one maid servant in the know,
The rest will be surprised, yo!

As they set sail, they feel the power,
Of the gods in this crucial hour,
Telemachus and crew so bold,
Will find his dad and be so gold.

Yo, Telemachus is a boss,
Leading his squad to a righteous cause.
They loaded up their gear with haste,
And off they set with no time to waste.

Minerva, goddess of wisdom and such,
Took a seat and whispered, "Don't fuss too much."
As the crew set the sails with might,
A fair wind blew, oh what a sight!

They pulled the ropes, hoisted their gear,
Set the mast, and had no fear.
The ship rode the waves with skill,
And the foam splashed, like a Chili's grill.

The crew made drink offerings to the skies,
Calling to the gods with teary eyes.
The daughter of Jove received their praise,
For guiding them through these stormy days.

Oh snap, the ship's on the move,
From late night hours, it don't approve.
Speeding through the darkness so tight,
Making its way till morning light.

The sails are up, the wind is strong,
The ship is lit and nothing's wrong.
It's cruising through the sea so vast,
Going fast, faster than a TikTok dance.

From dusk till dawn, the ship does sail,
No time to waste, no time to fail.
The crew is savage, they know their stuff,
Working hard, they ain't giving up.

So if you want a story to behold,
The ship's journey is pure gold.
Filled with hype and pure delight,
This ship's journey is one to write.

What up, what up, let me put it in the mix,
Got a story that'll leave you like, "oh, shi*!"

Got a tale so epic, you won't believe your eyes,
No cap, it's gonna have you feeling hella fly.

It's like a movie, but in real time,
So massive, it's straight up prime.

We're talking 'bout drama, suspense, and mystery,
It's crazier than the Kardashian family history.

This story's got more twists than a pretzel,
It's hotter than the sauce on a Chipotle vessel.

It's gonna make you jump, scream, and shout,
Like the reaction to that Vine of that kid who's all about.

So sit back and chill, and get ready for a ride,
This story's so wicked, it's gonna be your new vibe.

BOOK III

As the sun rose high in the sky,
Telemachus and crew came nigh
To Pylos, where bulls were being sacrificed,
The people praying that Neptune be pleased and pacified.

Guilds of five hundred, nine in all,
With nine bulls burning, tall and strong and tall.
As they ate the meat and drank the wine,
Telemachus and crew arrived just in time.

They furled the sails, brought the ship to rest,
And disembarked with a feeling of zest.
The people of Pylos greeted them with cheer,
Their hospitality truly sincere.

But little did Telemachus know,
Athena was guiding him, ready to bestow
Wisdom and courage, and help him find
His father, who was lost to mankind.

Yo Telemachus, don't be shy or nervous,
Minerva wants us to be straight and purposeful,
We're on a quest and it's quite suspenseful,
To find out where your father's memory deserves.

Straight up to Nestor, we'll boldly go,
To inquire about the truth of our sorrow,
He'll spill the beans, that's for sure-o,
For he's an excellent person, no shade or borrow.

Beg him to speak truth, and nothing but the fact,
We won't tolerate any kind of act,
We're here for answers, not to overreact,
We'll leave no stone unturned, that's our pact.

So let's go, Telemachus, let's do this thing,
We'll find out the truth, that's what we bring,
We're on a mission, and we won't miss a string,
Let's vibe and see what Nestor will sing.

"Ayy, don't sweat it, T-mach," replied the Mentor with a grin,
"You gotta start somewhere, let the conversation begin.
Just be yourself, but show respect to the old man,
And don't forget to sprinkle some swag in your game plan.

Maybe start with a, 'What's good, my dude?'
Then show interest in his stories to set the mood.
Ask 'bout his past and his legendary feats,
And for sure, he'll spill the tea, no beats.

Remember to keep it light and keep it fun,
Throw in some memes, and you'll be his number one.
So go out there, Telemachus, and show what you've got,
And make memories with Nestor that can never be bought."

Oh, Telemachus, my dude,
Your instinct will guide you, it's true,
Heaven's on your side,
So just take it in stride.

The gods have been watching since birth,
You're destined for greatness, it's worth,
Trust yourself and your gut,
Don't let anyone tarnish your strut.

You got this, believe in yourself,
You'll conquer your battles with stealth,
The world is your oyster,
All you need is some moisture.

Like the gods that have guided you so,
Your success will continue to grow,
Just keep being true,
And you'll make it through.

It's like the meme says, "You've got this!" 
Your success will be lit, more than a fireworks blitz!

Telemachus was shook, this was wild,
Nestor was sitting with his homies in a huddle piled,
As they walked up, the crew greeted them with love,
Like they were blessings from the gods above.
Pisistratus dapped them up with his fist,
And they sat on sheepskins, definitely not missed.
The meat was cookin', the smell was so fly,
And Nestor's son poured them wine, they could die.
But the real kicker was Minerva, so iconic,
She got the golden cup first, and you know she'd bionic.

"Yo, dude, show some respect, 
It's King Neptune's feast we'll connect.
Before we raise our cup to sip, 
offer a prayer to let Neptune flip.
Your friend will do the same in kind, 
we can't survive without God in mankind.
I know he's young like me, 
but you're older, so let the priority be.
Pass the cup and let's get lit, 
with this righteous act, we commit."

Minerva sipped her tea, feeling like a queen
While praying to Neptune, her voice serene
Neptune, sweet Neptune, King of the sea
Listen to our prayers, and hear our plea
Bless Nestor and his sons, make their lives great
For the hecatomb they give, let them have a savory plate
Telemachus and I, we seek your favor
May our quest bring us happiness to savor

As Nestor spoke, the party was lit,
The guests were hyped and didn't want to quit.
They chowed down on meat that was roasted well,
Each plate emptied with a satisfied swell.

Telemachus and Penelope prayed,
Their gratefulness, they loudly conveyed.
Then they feasted on food with a hearty zest,
Every guest leaving feeling their best.

Nestor, knight of Gerene, spoke out loud,
His voice so clear, it captured the crowd.
With wisdom he spoke and stories to tell,
Everyone listened, they were under his spell.

Aye aye, sire, we're not here to cause any harm.
We're just some lit sailors, chillin' on the seas so calm.
We're not pirates, man, you gotta trust our vibe.
We're just a bunch of traders, trying to stay alive.
We've sailed from afar, from a port you might not know,
We're just tryna make some dough, you know how it goes, bro.
So what's your deal, man? You seem kinda tense,
Don't worry, we're not here to give you any offense.

Oh snap, Telemachus coming in brave,
Thanks to Minerva, he won't behave.
He's asking 'bout his dad, gotta know,
Making sure his name's not low.
Minerva's got his back so he won't crack,
Telemachus on the rise, that's a fact.

Yo Nestor, I'm here to ask
about Ulysses, a hero without a mask
We come from Ithaca, under Neritum's reign,
and his fate is shrouded, causing us great pain

He's said to have sacked the town of ancient Troy,
but his fate's hidden from us, no evidence to deploy
Did he fall in battle or lost at sea?
We need to know, please tell us truly

I'm begging you, please don't soften the truth,
just give it to me straight, like in your youth
If Ulysses had ever helped you out,
tell me now, don't leave me in doubt.

Oh dang, Nestor, your story has got me shook,
The Achaeans suffered so much, it's like history took
All the bad luck and threw it at them, dang
Ajax and Achilles fell, it sounds so insane!

But it wasn't just them, it was like all of them fell
Even your son, Antilochus, though he ran hella well
For nine long years, they tried every single thing
But heaven was like, "nope" and they couldn't win.

But yo, Nestor, did you say what I think you did?
That this dude's dad was like you, in every single way, kid?
No way, it's like too good to be true, I s2g
But you two sound the same, it's like blowing my mind, g.

It's lit though that you and pop had such a bond
The Argives needed good advice, and y'all never spawned
Any sort of beef, y'all were like a team, for real
And that's why you're telling his kid the deal.

Okay boomer, let me school you on this bummer
Back when we sacked Priam, it was lit like summer
Our ships were set to sail, feeling blessed with big hype
But Jove had plans to vex us, giving us a tough type

Not all Argives were wise, some just lacked understanding
Causing bad ends for many, so devastating
Daughter of Zeus, Minerva caused a quarrel to ensue
Between two brothers Atreus, girls and guys, it's not new 

But hey, we bounced back and fought with all our might
Winning battles left and right like we come out at night
So remember this lesson when you're feeling down
Keep pushing forward, because greatness can always be found.

Yo, check it homies - The Atreus' sons called a meeting like they should,  
But the Achaeans heavy with wine were in no mood to do any good.  
Menelaus peaced out, said he's going home,  
But Agamemnon was upset, saying we need to atone.  

Foolish Agamemnon thought we needed to appease Athena's wrath,  
But the goddess had already decided on her path.  
The two started to argue, slingin' harsh words with ease,  
The Achaeans jumped up, unsure which way to please.  

Should they follow Menelaus, and sail away?  
Or should they stay and try to appease Athena's stay?  
The tension was high, the air thick with emotion,  
It was anyone's guess what would be the final notion.

That night we were angry and vexed,
Jove planned mischief against us, no text.
Next morning some of us sailed the sea,
Women and goods aboard, sailing free.

Half stayed behind with Agamemnon,
And the other half set our sails on.
We offered sacrifices to the gods on Tenedos shore,
Longing to get home, but there was more.

Cruel Jove raised another quarrel,
Some turned back, while we kept morale.
We pressed forward with Tydeus' son,
And his crew, adventurous and never undone.

Menelaus joined us at Lesbos island,
Making up our minds about our sailing stand.
Either outside Chios or inside,
We asked for a sign, to the gods we confide.

The sign showed us the way to Euboea,
We sailed across the open sea with zeal, no fear.
And a fair wind sprang up,
Quick passage during the night, no hiccup.

Four days later, Diomed stationed in Argos,
But I held on for Pylos, braving the sea's blows.
The wind kept fair since heaven's first favor,
Reaching home faster, to our life's savior.

Yo, young blood, I'm back to tell ya
About the peeps who made it and those in a coma
I've got no news on the folks that we miss
But let me share what's the gist

They say Neoptolemus, son of Achilles
Managed to return to Greece without any glitches
Philotetes, the brave son of Poias
Also made it back without any hitches

Idomeneus didn't lose anyone at sea
All his followers survived by his decree
And as for Agamemnon, you know, the king?
His tale's no mystery or hidden thing

Aegisthus, with blood on his hands
Paid for his evil and met his end
Orestes avenged his father's dread
Killed the traitor and left him dead

So listen up, young gun, and make it soar
Be like Orestes and leave your mark for sure!

Yo Nestor, my homie so cool,
Telemachus is no fool.
He wants to avenge his dad,
Just like Orestes, that's rad!

The suitors are causing him strife,
Plotting and causing him such life.
But heaven won't grant his request,
So he'll bear it, that's the test.

But let's hope someday he'll get his way,
And the suitors will have to pay.
Until then, we'll cheer him on,
And hope his journey won't be long.

"Yo, my dude," said Nestor full of clout,

"I heard through the grapevine you're dealing with some doubt.

Your mom's got suitors making a mess,

Destroying your estate, causing stress.

Do you just take it or is there a fight,

Against these haters who think they're tight?

Who knows, maybe Ulysses will return,

And these fools will get what they've earned.

Minerva liked your dad back in Troy,

She kept him safe and acted like his joy,

If she can protect you like she did him,

These suitors will forget their whims."

Oh man, Telemachus, don't be a bummer,
You gotta manifest that good summer,
Let the good vibes flow and don't be a drag,
Like a Hogwarts house elf, you gotta have swag.

I get it, the odds ain't lookin' great,
But why give up and seal your own fate?
You gotta believe and shoot for the stars,
Even when life hits you hard like a thousand cigars.

The gods might be willing to lend a hand,
But it's up to you to make your stand,
Don't be a victim of your own self-doubt,
Flex your confidence and let it all out.

Like memes and slang, life's full of surprises,
So live it up and don't be afraid to improvise,
You got this, Telemachus, just keep pushing through,
And the universe will reward you with blessings anew.

Oh snap, Telemachus, what's the deal?
You really think that coming home is no big steal?
But listen up fam, don't be so quick to jet,
Heaven's got a long arm if it wants to protect.

If I was in your shoes, I wouldn't care how long it takes,
I just want to be safe, protected by the fates.
I'd rather not rush and get to my own zone,
Just to get killed by the treachery at home.

As Agamemnon once faced, back in the day,
Aegisthus and his wife causing great dismay.
Death freaking sucks, but it's a certainty,
Even if the gods love you abundantly.

"Yo, Telemachus, let's switch gears, let's talk about the tears. Your dad might be gone, but let's not think about that con. Nestor's got the scoop, he's like a cool immortal loop. Agamemnon's death was whack, Menelaus was off track. Aegisthus was a fake, but he decided to take, Agamemnon's reign, thinking he'd have no more pain. But Menelaus was out, maybe on his surfing route, Aegisthus took the chance, thinking he'd have a better dance. But karma's a boomerang, and Aegisthus got the bang."

Listen up, I'll give you the true scoop,
Nestor's words will make you wanna whoop!
As Menelaus returned from a war so grand,
Aegisthus in his house did make his stand.
No tomb or mourning would be his reward,
For his wicked deed made him a discord.
But we were overseas, putting up a great fight,
While back in Argos, Aegisthus had delight.
He sweet-talked Clytemnestra with endless glee,
And that's how things went down, you see? 
Like the 'thirsty' guys in your DMs,
Aegisthus pulled out all the gems.

This tale's got drama like it's straight from a show,
Agamemnon's wife had feelings, but we all know,
Her man was off to Troy, so he left a bard in charge,
To keep an eye on things, and make sure she wasn't at large. 

But Aegisthus had plans, his scheme was pretty wicked,
He sent the bard away and the plan got quickly thickened, 
And when the gods intervened to choose her fate,
She went over to Aegisthus' house, their bond sealed by his bait. 

He offered up some burnt sacrifices to the gods above,
And decorated temples, his plan fitting like a glove,
His success exceeded all of his wildest dreams,
A victory so sweet, it sent shivers running down his seams.

Yo, let me hype up this Greek myth,
About Menelaus and his epic journey forthwith,
After the Trojan War, he was on his way home,
But Apollo's arrow made his steersman's fate roam.

Phrontis, the skilled guy he lost so soon,
Aye, the sea was violent, that day's no moon,
So Menelaus had to halt and pay respects,
A true bro of a captain, his loyalty perfects.

When the coast cleared, he set sail again,
But it wasn't long before his luck turned vain,
Jove, the king of gods, had other plans,
And he stirred the waves, with his mighty hands.

The fleet was split, half went towards Crete,
The Cydonians they were about to meet,
The rest went towards a headland hella high,
Where the rocks were sharp, and the waves went awry.

Ships were wrecked, the crew barely survived,
The other boats went to Egypt, Menelaus thrived,
He collected gold and riches of alien speech,
While at home, Aegisthus plotted and did breach.

He ruled Mycene for seven years with pride,
The people were obedient under his guide,
But in the eighth year, Orestes stopped by,
To make bad Aegisthus pay and die.

Orestes, a noble lad, did his folks proud,
He hosted a banquet and made his family proud,
And that very day, Menelaus came back,
With tons of treasure, his voyages never slack.

Yo Listen up, homes, it's time to wise up,
Leaving home with those guys, better rise up,
They'll eat up everything, turning tides up,
Your property would be gone, I don't need to remind up. 

But let me tell you, there�s still hope,
Menelaus, who with distant peoples has had to cope,
Worse than crossing a banana-peel-covered slope,
His voyage was so far, it�ll make you mope.

Travelling by sea with your own men,
In a chariot with horses, if that's your yen,
My sons, Lacedaemon, will be your den,
Menelaus will tell the truth, for he's no pretend. 

He's an excellent person, straight-up shot caller,
His word�s his bond, not like trust fund baller,
So take my advice, don't even bother,
Just head to Menelaus, he's the one to holler. 

And don't forget, when you're at your wit's end,
Just remember "Ight Imma head out," like Spongebob's friend,
For traveling to Menelaus, there�s no need to pretend,
Your journey will be lit, homie, have fun until the end!

'Did you just say it's time for bed, oh Goddess of wisdom?'
'Before that, let's pour some wine and cut tongues with precision.'
'We'll make our offerings to Neptune and the gods up above.'
'And then, my dude, it's time for us to call it a night and get some love.'
 'As much as I'd love to stay up and chill,' Odysseus said with a frown.
'I need my beauty sleep, so let's wrap this up and wind down.'
'Thanks for the advice, Minerva, you truly are the best.'
'Now, let's cut some tongues and make some offerings, aight, let's give it our best.'

Yo, hold up, stop right there, Nestor's got something to share. 
He caught up to Telemachus and Athena, giving them quite a scare. 
After they made their offerings and drank their fill, 
Nestor had some wisdom to spill. 

"Stay a bit longer, my guests, I insist, 
There's something important that you don't wanna miss. 
I heard you mention Odysseus, the great friend of mine,
Let's talk about him and share some wine. 

You see, I know a lot about that fabled man, 
He was a hero like no other, with an epic plan. 
But now he's gone, and no one knows where he may be, 
It's been years since he set sail, tragedy after tragedy." 

Telemachus listened intently, wondering what he might learn, 
He wanted answers about his father, for whom he had so much yearn. 
Athena, too, was curious, her mind sharp and bright,
She wanted to know more about the great Odysseus' plight.

So they stayed a bit longer, to hear Nestor's tale,
To learn about Odysseus and his epic, heroic tale.

Bro, hold up, he said with a shout
Do you really wanna leave and sail about?
Do you think I'm so broke, so tight on cash?
That I can't provide you with a cozy stash?

Let me tell you, I have loads of rugs and clothes,
Enough for me, my fam, and all my bros.
No way, my dude, will you sleep on a boat,
Not while I'm alive, no way, no joke!

My sons will follow, that's the way we roll,
We'll keep open house, we're on a roll!
So c'mon and chill, don't be in a hurry,
We're all homies here, no need to worry!

"OK, OK, OK!" I exclaimed, "This plan is fire!
Telemachus, go with Nestor, let him be your sire.
Minerva, you go back, to give those sailors some cheer,
Young bucks on a quest, nothing they’ll fear.

"There's money to be had, the Cauconians owe you some cash,
Get your coin girl, build up your stash.
Nestor, you the OG, take Telemachus under your wing,
Get him a dope ride and make that boy sing.

"Best horses for Telemachus, let him flex his speed,
This journey will be one gnarly deed.
I'm hyped to see how this will all unfold,
Let's see what fire and adventure will be unrolled!"

Oh my goodness, did you hear?
Telemachus got a visit so dear
From the Trito-born queen of the skies
Who flew away in eagle disguise

Nestor was shook, and took his hand
Said, "You'll be a hero in this land
The gods must be watching over you
To have such favour, that's so true"

He asked for the queen's grace to come down
On him, his wife, and kids all around
And as an offering, he would be so bold
To give a heifer with horns of gold

Wow, Nestor knows how to make a deal
And he's got a great offering to reveal
Let's hope the queen accepts it with grace
And showers them with blessings and a smiling, emoji-filled face

Yo, Telemachus was in the town,
And his fam were gettin' down.
Nestor's place was where they stayed,
And sweet wine was the drink they made.

This wine was from eleven years past,
But Nestor poured it fast.
He prayed to Athena up above,
For grace and peace and lots of love.

When they finished drinks to the hilt,
They all laid down and soon grew still.
Telemachus, son of dear Odysseus,
Slept with Pisistratus, Nestor's precious.

Nestor and his wifey boo,
Slept in their room, cozy and true. 
Minerva was watchin', we can bet,
Makin' sure they slept safe and sound, you betcha.

Yo, it's a new day dawning, and Nestor's swarming
Around his crib made of marble that's shining,
His papa, Neleus, used to sit on these thrones,
But now he uses Hades as his new home.
Nestor's sceptre's ready to rule the land,
His five sons by his side, making a strong band,
Telemachus now also chilling with them,
Joining Nestor and his squad of mighty men.
And here's the tea, Nestor's about to speak,
Pouring out his thoughts, staying on the beat.
So, let's sit back, catch up with the act,
And see what Nestor has to say, that's a fact.

Alright, my dudes, listen up and hear me now,
Pop quiz: which Greek god is said to be endowed?
The one, the only, goddess so serene,
The wise Athena, who should be first seen.

So, let's get this party started with some haste,
Pick up the phone, call the stockman with some grace,
Tell him to find a heifer so divine,
Quickly hurry, don't waste any more time!

And to Telemachus's ship we go,
Invite the crew, make sure they all know,
Leave two behind to watch the ship with care,
Off to the feast, let's all beware!

Ooh, and don't forget the goldsmith, you guys,
Grab Laerceus, and don't be slow to rise,
We need to gild those horns up real bright,
Make sure they shine so we can sleep through the night.

To the maids in the house, we'll give a shout,
Cook us up something good, that's what it's all about,
Fetch us some wood, some seats and some water clear,
We're going to praise Athena, let's make that clear.

So there you have it, my peeps, that's the plan,
Let's execute it well, like only Greeks can.
And if you do just as I say,
Trust me, your wild rave reviews will make my day!

Okay, let me tell you 'bout what went down,
Nestor's crew was running all over town.
They brought in a heifer, pretty and fine,
Telemachus's crew joined in just in time.

The goldsmith came with his trusty tools,
Anvil, hammer, tongs, he ain't no fool.
And even our girl Minerva was there,
Ready for the sacrifice, without a care.

Nestor handed out the gold like it ain't no thing,
And the smith gilded the horns so they would bling.
Then Stratius and Echephron grabbed her by the head,
While Aretus brought in water with a flower pattern instead.

Thrasmyedes stood by with his axe so sharp,
And Perseus held a bucket without a harp.
Nestor cleansed his hands and said a prayer,
As he threw a lock of hair into the fire with care.

Yo, the story of Nestor and the heifer is wild,
The daughters and daughters-in-law were hype and smiled,
They watched Thrasymedes cut through the cattle's neck,
And the women screamed with glee, that's what I call a flex.

Pisistratus sliced the throat, the heifer was dead,
Cutting it up, they had meat and bones to shred,
They put some raw meat on the thigh bones for flavor,
And Nestor poured wine, yo, they had mad flavor.

The young men held five-pronged spits in their hands,
And toasted the meat over fire, what do you understand?
It's all about the taste, the culture and the feast,
Nestor and his family, they definitely had a beast.

With inward meats tasted, the feast was almost done,
They cut up the rest of the meat, that's how it's done,
Popped it on the spits and toasted it to perfection,
Nestor and his fam, that's a great tradition.

Polycaste, Nestor's daughter, gave Telemachus a wash,
Anointed him with oil, made him look like a boss.
She gave him a shirt and a mantle that were fair,
He sat by Nestor, feeling without a care.

They drew off the meats, sat down to dinner,
Waited upon by henchmen, like worthy winners.
Golden cups of wine were poured out with glee,
Nestor spoke up, his voice loud and free.

"Sons, put Telemachus's horses to the chariot,
Let him start at once, it's time to hurry, it's time to jet."
Telemachus got up, ready for the next phase,
He was off to find his dad, the voyage began with a blaze.

Telemachus, man about town,
Got in the chariot, rode around.
Pisistratus, decked out and fly,
Sat beside him with a sigh.

The horses yoked and ready to go,
Off they flew with a mighty glow.
They left Pylos behind, oh so grand,
Their chariot flew across the land.

All day they swayed with a mighty force,
Their journey taking them far off course.
They passed the night at Diocles' place,
With sweet hospitality kissing their face.

Come morning, they again took the lead,
Out through the gateway, picking up speed.
They came to the corn fields, high and tall,
Their horses taking them through it all.

Finally, their journey came to an end,
Their journey did bend and curve and wend.
But thanks to their mighty steeds so fleet,
They had triumphed over many a feat.

The scene was set for something grand.
I heard a story that was totally fire,
It had me hooked, my heart was a desired.

The teller started with "Hey fam, hear this,"
And I was ready for a tale of bliss.
She said, "Once upon a time in a land far away,
A story of courage and love that'll make your day."

I said "Tell me more sis, what can I expect?"
She replied "Picture it, a meme-worthy effect!
A protagonist that's cooler than ice,
a plot that's spicy, with no need for spice."

I was getting excited, I couldn't pretend,
The epic story that was about to transcend.
And as she went on with her narrative,
I knew that the ending was gonna be lit.

So now, whenever I think of that night,
I always look back with pure delight.
That story was something that'll stay with me,
And in my heart, it'll always be free.

Yo, what's up my squad, let me tell you a story that's not a fraud.
It's about a dude who thought he was slick, but ended up looking like he got hit with a brick.

He slid into her DMs, thinking he could win her heart,
But little did he know, his smooth moves would fall apart.

He hit her with the classic "wyd",
But she wasn't impressed, she just hit back with an "lol why?"

He thought he'd try a pick-up line,
But she shut him down with a simple decline.

He started to panic, his ego taking a hit,
He didn't know what to do with himself, not one little bit.

He thought memes were the key to her heart,
But his jokes fell flat, they didn't even start.

In the end, he had to face the music,
His attempts to woo her were just plain stupid.

So let this be a lesson to all my internet crew,
Slide into DMs at your own risk, you might end up feeling blue.

BOOK IV

As they approached Lacedaemon, a city so stout,
They drove straight to Menelaus, with no doubt.
He was in his own house, feasting and all,
Honoring the wedding of his son and daughter, having a ball.

The daughter was getting wed to Achilles' son,
Their love story being told for years, it was done.
He had made a promise while fighting in Troy,
And now, the gods were making it a joy.

He was sending her with horses and chariots,
To the city of Myrmidons, all hailing it.
For his only son, he had found a bride,
This blessing brought happiness, nowhere to hide.

Born to him of a bondwoman, Megapenthes was his name,
From heavens, no more children to Helen, it was a shame.
Although Hermione, fair as golden Venus herself,
Was with them, their love was never on the shelf.

Yo, the party at Menelaus' is lit,
His neighbours and kinsmen are all legit.
Blasting tunes and rhymes with the bard on the lyre,
While the tumblers flip and perform higher.

The man's tune was fire, you gotta know,
Like Drake dropping his latest flow.
The crowd's energy was off the chain,
No one could resist the urge to maintain.

As the night went on, they laughed and cheered,
A glimpse of the good life, they all revered.
The memes and slangs were flying around,
Everyone at the party was internet-bound.

And that's how the party went down,
A true display of culture that astounds.
Menelaus' crib was the place to be,
A night to remember for eternity.

Oh my gosh, Menelaus, please listen up quick,
Strangers at the gate, are they here for a trick?
They look like demigods, sons of Jove, I swear,
Shall we take their horses out, or leave them with care?

Do we let them in, or show them to the door?
Maybe they came only to even the score,
We shouldn't judge a book by its cover,
Maybe they're lost, looking for their mother.

Let's give them a chance, and offer hospitality,
A few drinks and food will show our nobility,
Who knows, they could be friends forever,
Or we could bond over our love for Trevor. (Noah Centineo?)

So Eteoneus, let's welcome them in,
Hoping that our new friendship will begin,
And if they don't turn out as we would expect,
We'll handle the situation with mutual respect.

Yo, Eteoneus, don't act like a clown,
Take their horses out of town.
Invite them in and give them grub,
We've stayed at other peeps' house, no need to snub.

Menelaus ain't happy, he's super mad,
But we gotta be good hosts, ain't that rad?
We'll show them some hospitality,
And maybe they'll bring some vitality.

Let's hope we can rest now, without strife,
And live our best life, drama-free life.
But first, we gotta take care of these guests,
And treat them like kings, better than the rest.

Eteoneus told his homies to come fast,
They took off the yoke and gave the horses a repast.
They chowed down on oats and barley mixed,
And then into the house they quickly fixed.

Telemachus and Pisistratus were both shook,
The house was luxurious, like a celebrity's look.
It shone like the sun and moon so bright,
They couldn't believe it was all in sight.

After the house tour, they went to the bath,
Washing off the dirt and taking a deep laugh.
Like a spa day but just for the fellas,
Relaxing after their journey to dwellas.

So Menelaus was chillin' with his homies,
when they pulled up lookin' sharp and not so lonely.
The servants got them lookin' fresh and clean,
Dripping in oil like a queen supreme.

The maidservant came through with the golden ewer,
pouring water so fresh you'd swear it's pure,
into a silver basin by their hand,
Cleansing their mitts like it's part of the plan.

The upper servant blessed them with some bread,
And laid out a feast for them well-fed.
With plates of meat and cups of gold,
These guys were set to have stories told.

Yo, Menelaus was all like "Fall to, don't be shy,
When you're done with your supper, I gotta ask why,
Who you are and where you from, I gotta pry,
Such noble heritage, can't be denied."

Menelaus peeped their lineage, he was keen,
Said only kings could have sons so pristine,
No way they came from poverty, that's obscene,
Their royal bloodline was clearly seen.

I bet these men were sipping on that tea,
Living their best lives, happy as can be,
They were definitely woke, we can all agree,
Menelaus knew they weren't no bourgeoisie.

Oh my, Telemachus is spittin' heat,
Check out that juicy meat they're about to eat.
Feast your eyes on all that bronze and gold,
It's like seeing the palace of the gods, so bold.

Telemachus whispers in Pisistratus' ear,
He wants no one else to overhear.
"Damn, bro, this place is so lit!
I can't even handle it, not one bit."

The shine of amber, ivory, and silver,
Is enough to make us all quiver.
Telemachus is feeling pure admiration,
This palace is the ultimate destination.

I can't help but feel the same way too,
This palace is making me feel brand new.
Let's eat that roast loin with all our might,
And party like it's the end of the night.

Listen up, my peeps, this a tale to tell,
Menelaus got a story, let's listen well.
Jove's immortal, and his riches never-ending
But mortal men's wealth may be equal or bending.
For years on end he travelled the world,
Went to Cyprus, Phoenicia, the bags were twirled.
Went to Ethiopia, the Sidonians and the Erembians too,
And to Libya where the lambs are born with horns, oh who knew?
The milk, cheese and meat were in abundance there,
Enough to satisfy the stomachs anywhere.
But while he was gone, his brother was slain,
By his wife's wickedness, causing him so much pain.
His mansion and riches don't please him anymore,
He wishes he had less wealth, lost in Troy's war.
The loss that made him grieve the most,
Was a man who risked it all, the great Achaean host.
He risked his life, but gained not a thing,
It's unknown if he's alive or if death's sting
Has taken him away, leaving his family to sorrow,
His son, wife, and father with their hearts in the burrow.

Yo, Menelaus spoke truth,
And Telemachus, he felt it too,
His heart yearned for his father's return,
Tears pouring out like a river churned.
Menelaus wondered what was the deal,
Should he ask at once or let him feel?
To speak his truth when ready, or to force it out,
Like when you're hangry and ready to shout.

Oh dang, Helen came down from her room, looking fine as a glow-up on zoom. Adraste brought a seat, Alcippe a soft rug, it was all so comfy like a warm hug. Phylo brought a silver work-box - oh my gosh, that's lit! Alcandra's gift was a hit! Polybus was a boss, yo! From Egyptian Thebes, where the gold doth flow. He gave Menelaus two baths of pure silver, not too shabby for a wealthy giver. Ten talents of gold were in the mix, his generosity gave everyone a fix. And Helen, boo - she got the real treat, a gold distaff and a silver box on wheels, so neat. Phylo placed it beside her, with yarn and wool, Helen settled in, looking cool. She put her feet up, started to chat, "Hey Menelaus, where you been at?"

Yo, Menelaus, I must confess
These strangers got me quite impressed
Do we know their names, can we guess?
I swear, one of them's like Telemachus, no stress!

This young man's features are so alike
It's hard for me to even spike
What I think and feel inside - it's trike!
Like they're both dolls from the same Levike!

Ulysses left Telemachus while he was a tot
It was a sad event that left us in knots
Now these strangers here, in our ports
Might be the ones we've missed, our thoughts.

You know what they say, it's a small world
Even with our hair curled and twirled
People can look alike and be swirled
Into an adventure, a story unfurled!

I can't wait to see what happens next
Will they surpass some tricky text?
We'll see if they're heroes or suspects,
And if their journey leads to some big connects!

Okay, hold up, hold up, let me tell you 'bout a story,
Of Menelaus, his homie, and his wife all in glory.
They saw a dude who looked like Ulysses by his side,
With the same hair and feet, they couldn't decide.

Menelaus talked about Ulysses, and then,
This mysterious guy cries, like, tears and shiz, amen?
He hid his face 'cause he was feelin' all the pain,
Of Ulysses and the suffering he sustained.

It's crazy how one man's journey can touch so many,
Even strangers cryin' for him, I can't believe any.
Ulysses must be one heck of a dude,
To make grown men weep, feelings all renewed.

Yo, Menelaus, I gotta say
Your instincts are on fleek today
This young man's name is Telemachus, it's true
But he's too humble to speak with you

My pops, Nestor, sent me to guide
Telemachus here, to get inside 
Your mind divine and pick your brain
For advice that might ease his pain

You know how it is, home's a wreck
When Dad's not there to jump in the mix
Telemachus needs a hand to hold
Cause no one supports him, it's getting old

Menelaus, you're talking about Telemachus, the son of your friend,
The one who's with me now, and on this mission to tend.
You had hoped to host him with distinction, give him the best,
Founding a city for him, and building a house with zest.

You would have made him leave Ithaca, with goods and clan,
And sacked a neighbouring city, just because you can.
You'd have seen each other often, and real tight,
Nothing but death could have interrupted your insight.

But alas, heaven had other plans, it seems,
Stopping Telemachus' father's dreams.
But now here he stands, in front of you today,
Ready to chase off the suitors and slay.

So let's get to work and stop this wooing mess,
And make sure Telemachus has victory, nothing less.
We'll show those suitors who's really in charge,
And send them running, just like a viral meme, it's large.

Bro, your words hit me hard,  
Got me crying, feeling like a bard.  
Helen, Telemachus, all of us in tears,  
Even Pisistratus, holding back his fears.  

Antilochus, man, he was real,  
Lost his life in battle, Achilles' steel.  
Bright Dawn took him away,  
Now he's gone, forever to stay.  

Menelaus, your grief is heard,  
We'll all remember Antilochus' word.  
The battles he fought, the courage he showed,  
Antilochus' memory will forever glow.  

In his honor, let's raise a glass,  
Cheers to our brother, who's now in the past.  
May he rest in peace, forevermore,  
Antilochus, we will always adore.  

*cries in Gen-Z*

Yo, listen up, my dear old sir,
Your understanding's rare, that's for sure.
If it's possible, do as I urge,
No time for tears, let's get to the dessert.
Morning will come, the sun will rise,
In the forenoon, we'll mourn all those goodbyes.
All we can do is shave our heads,
And let out all our tears in threads.
A brother of mine died in Troy,
Name's Antilochus, oh boy.
He was quite a champ in his own right,
Fighting enemies with all his might.
But now he's gone, we can't see his face,
All we can do is mourn and embrace.

Aye, Menelaus, you spittin' the truth with finesse,
Discretion, my guy, you got it on fleek, no stress.
You talkin' 'bout Nestor, that's a boss man,
He blessed with a wifey and dope offspring all grand.

Let's stop this weeping and bury it deep,
Let's eat our grub and not stay up too late to sleep.
Pour water on our hands and cleanse our souls,
And chow down on some food that's filling our bowls.

Telemachus and I'll have a chat tomorrow,
No worries, we're homies, no need to feel sorrow.
We'll catch up on life and spill all the tea,
But right now, let's focus on food and be carefree.

Yo, let me tell you 'bout Asphalion,
Where they pour water and get their hands on,
All the tasty goods in front,
Serving up meals that you'll want to flaunt.

They wash their hands like a boss,
'Cause hygiene doesn't have a loss,
Then they feast on that prime cuisine,
Tasting flavors like they've never seen.

Asphalion's got it all down,
No need to wear a fancy crown,
Just chill and enjoy the spread,
Like a cool meme that's been well-said.

Helen was feeling pretty clever,
So she spiked the wine with a special lever,
An herb that banished all your sorrows,
A perfect cure for all your morrows.
No tears would fall from anyone's eyes,
Not even if their family dies.
This potent power was given by Polydamna,
Wife of Thon, from Egypt, where they grow some dank flora.
Paeeon's descendants are all skilled in the art of healing,
That's just common knowledge, there's no need for feeling. 
Helen then instructed the servants to serve the wine,
And everything seemed to be going just fine.

Hey y'all, it's story time
Listen while I tell you a tale so fine
About Ulysses and his sneaky little trick
Took Troy down with his disguise so slick

He wore rags and got all bruised
Into the enemy's city he cruised
No one recognized him, what a sly fox
Except for Helen's boy, who called him out of the box

But Ulysses was too smart for that
He didn't give in to the skilled diplomat
After he was washed, dressed and sworn to secrecy 
He spilled all the tea on Trojan activity

He killed a lot of them, got important intel too
And the Trojan women wailed, "Boo-hoo"
But for Menelaus, it was all Gucci
He was happy to hear all of Ulysses' newsy

Venus took Althaea's husband away
But this story ain't about that betrayal
It's about Trojan demise with Ulysses at play
So let's give it up for his disguise portrayal

Menelaus, my man, I totally agree,
Ulysses is the one king that reigns supreme,
He showed bravery and endurance ahoy,
In the wooden horse, he played coy.
And then, oh snap, you came talkin' smack,
Deiphobus by your side with the attack.
You pat our hiding place, made a fuss,
Called out our chiefs one by one, oh shush!
But Ulysses, bruh, he held us all firm,
Stopped Anticlus from getting outta turn,
Thank God for that, or we would be toast,
Saved by our boy, our ultimate host.

Yo, Telemachus is shook, oh my gosh! 
All his efforts? Total wash, oh my posh!
His courage, strong as iron in the fray,
But victory escaped him anyway. 

Now let's just hit the hay and catch some Z's,
So we wake up refreshed with no bad fleas.
Let's all lie down and get some sleep,
And tomorrow, y'all know we'll continue to reap.

Yo, listen up, let me tell you a tale,
Of Telemachus, son of Odysseus the male.
He went on a journey with Pisistratus by his side,
To find his dad and restore his family's pride.

They stopped at the gates of a mansion so grand,
And came across the queen of beauty, Helen so tanned.
She ordered her maids to make beds with red rugs,
And woollen cloaks too, for the guests to hug.

So the maids went out, carrying a torch,
And made the beds, as if it were their porch.
Telemachus and Pisistratus slept outside,
While Atreus' son had Helen as his guide.

In the forecourt, they dozed off to sleep,
While Atreus' son had dreams, oh so deep.
Helen by his side, he felt so serene,
A beauty queen like her, could never be a has been.

Yo, what's up, my dude, let's chat and chill,
I woke up feeling fly, like ready to kill,
I look like a god, my style's so clean,
I'm Menelaus, the hottest king you've seen.

But let's get down to business, no time to waste,
I need to know, what brings you to this place?
You've got the looks, the attitude, the swag,
But why leave your crib, why cramp your dad's rag?

I know you're searching for your daddy-O,
And I respect that, it's a gnarly go,
But here's the tea, you're in a messy fix,
With suitors after you, trying to mix.

They wanna marry your mom, take her cash,
And you're the obstacle, the only clash,
So we gotta scheme, gotta be sly,
And make them think, you'll never say bye.

We'll show them what's up, we'll make them see,
That you'll reclaim your throne, be wild and free,
With me by your side, your wingman for life,
We'll make Homer's Odyssey, come to life.

Oh dang, hold up, who knew 
Telemachus was taking a trip to Lacedaemon, too?
Is it for the government or for his own thing?
Come on, spill the tea, let's hear that ring-a-ding-ding! 

I know it's been a long time since we last spoke,
But don't be shy, dude, let's get this convo woke.
What's the story, what's the 411?
I wanna know everything, every detail, every run-on.

Is he doing it for the 'gram, a new adventure to explore?
Or maybe he's going undercover, like a secret agent for sure.
Either way, tell me all about it, no need to be coy.
I'm all ears, dude, spill the tea with joy!

Yo, Telemachus, no need to be shy,
I'm down to help you, so just tell me why
You're here standing in front of me, 
What's up with your family?

You say your crib's being eaten alive,
And your pops is MIA, no longer alive,
You wanna know how he died, 
Whether he drowned or was fried?

No need to hold back for my sake,
I'll tell you straight up, make no mistake
If your dad helped me back in the day,
I'd be happy to repay.

I'll tell you what I know, 
No need for you to put on a show,
Whether I saw it or heard it,
My words won't be a bit legit.

But your dad, he was a man to never rest,
He was brave, adventurous, and one of the best,
He got caught up in some trouble,
And the whole situation turned into rubble.

But I won't sugar-coat or hide the truth,
Your dad met his end, that's the proof,
He fought valiantly 'til the very end,
But the journey was too hard to extend.

Now don't you worry, don't you fret,
Your dad's legacy will never ever forget,
He will be remembered for ages and ages,
And your quest will surely turn many pages. 

Keep your head up, things will turn out fine,
Stay strong like your dad, and you'll do just fine,
Remember, life's a journey, it's not the end,
And with that, my young friend, we shall ascend.

Yo, Menelaus was so shocked,
He couldn't believe what he had clocked.
These cowards want to take the bed,
Like, bro, are they out of their heads?

It's like a hind leaving her young,
In a lion's den, which is mad dumb.
When the lion comes back, it's all over,
Just like how Ulysses will end these lovers.

By Jove, Minerva, and Apollo,
If Ulysses fights like he did in Lesbos, oh boyo,
These suitors won't get a chance to say "I do",
They'll be gone, like a meme that's already through.

About the old man of the sea, no lie,
Menelaus won't try to deceive or deny,
He'll spill the tea, spill it fast,
Like how VSCO girls spill their Hydro Flasks.

Yo, this Grecian man's tale is quite the jam,
He was stuck in Egypt, hatching a plan.
His big thanksgiving feast wasn't enough,
The gods were mad, they needed more stuff.

He had to sail away to an island called Pharos,
They had a good harbor, enough for his cause.
But the gods weren't pleased, they becalmed his ship,
Twenty whole days, no fair wind, such a drip.

His crew was hungry, they needed a meal,
They would've starved if not for Idothea's deal.
She was Proteus's daughter, a real savior,
She helped him out, with a move of godly favor. 

Thanks to her, this hero lives to tell,
Of how a goddess saved him so well. 
This story's lit, it's something to tweet,
It's got everything, even the kitchen sink.

Oh man, this story's about to get real profound
The speaker's feeling lost, no direction can be found
A lady approaches him, with words sharp as a knife,
Saying he's comfortable starving, with no energy or life.

But wait, where's that sound coming from?
It's the island, and everyone's fishing, one by one.
The men cast their barbed hooks, hoping to get a catch,
But nothing can be found, no food for anyone to match.

The lady urges the speaker, to escape this misery,
To save his men and leave this island, that's no longer free.
Her insights are crushing, her tone so sincere,
She's like a wise friend, that's always near.

So will he take her advice and leave this land?
Or stay in his comfort zone, with no helping hand?
The story's still there, and we'll never know,
But the lesson's quite clear, an opportunity in life, don't let it go!

Yo, let me spill the tea,
I'm not staying here, can't you see?
I think I angered the gods,
Living life against the odds.
Which goddess is causing me strife?
And how do I escape this life?
The gods know all, that's no lie,
Can't you help a homie out and reply?
Cause seriously, I gotta go,
Snapchat awaits, you know how it goes.

Yo, listen up, I'll make this clear,
About a guy you really ought to fear,
Proteus, an old immortal, lives in the sea,
An Egyptian legend, a mystery to thee.

He's Neptune's head man, with knowledge profound,
To catch him tight, in the depths you must be bound,
He'll help you with your voyage, make you wise,
And guide you on the path to reach the skies.

He'll spill the tea, if you dare to ask,
About your home, your family, your task,
All the deets, good and bad, he'll share,
And you'll be ready to face the truth, if you dare. 

So gear up now, and catch him soon,
With Proteus on your side, you'll be over the moon,
He knows the seas like the back of his hand,
And with his help, you'll soon make land. 

Now go, go, go, and don't you stop,
Until you snare that old immortal and make him pop,
Use all the tricks in the book, don't be shy,
And soon you'll be sailing high like a butterfly! #ProteusPower

Oh, snap! That's a tough one, man,
But I'm the hype assistant - I'm your biggest fan!
To catch a god like that, you'll need a sly plan,
Something sneaky, crafty, and totally off-brand.

Let me help you out, listen up, bro,
We need a disguise, something no one will know,
We'll blend in with the gods, from head to toe,
And catch this old timer before he says "woah!"

So, let's grab some wings and put on our best fit,
A Hermes staff too, we can't forget this bit!
We'll fly around fast as Twitter trends shift,
And catch that god before he knows we exist!

Now, let's add a filter, adjust the hue,
And post it all on Insta, for the world to view,
We'll show off our catch, like it's something new,
And everyone will think we're the coolest crew.

"Listen up, homie, let me make this clear,
When the sun hits its peak, you gotta gear up, no fear.
The man of the sea rises, the West wind making waves,
He snoozes in his cave, where the seals are his faves.

Halosydne's chickens, that's what they're called,
They smell like fish, and they're quite enthralled.
Tomorrow, I'll show you where to hide,
And all the tricks of the trade, I'll confide.

Gather your three best dudes, this is no drill,
We'll be like the Avengers, taking down the old man's skill.
So, be ready to pounce, be quick on your toes,
And we'll make sure that old man knows who's boss."

Yo, listen up quick, this ain't no trick,
The seals are the key, to catch this big freak.
He counts 'em up, on his five fingers, no cap,
Then he sleeps, among them, like a shepherd taking a nap.

When he dozes off, that's when you make the move,
Hold him tight, don't let him groove.
He'll try to escape, turning into fire and water,
But grip him stronger, like holding on to a quarter.

Once he talks to you, let the grip go light,
Question away, get your journey right.
Find out which god is mad, and why,
Then homeward bound, let out a sigh.

This ain't no myth, it's a classic tale,
Like that old-school meme, "epic fail".

Yo, so she jumped in the sea,
And I turned back to where my ships be.
My heart was heavy with care,
As I walked back with the cool night air.

Back at my ship, we cooked up some chow,
Camped on the beach, night was here now.
My mind was still on the ocean's mystery,
But my crew was chillin', not feelin' the history.

Yo, when the sun's pink fingers rose in sight,
I took three guys who were down to fight,
We trudged along the coast with all our might 
While I prayed to heaven with all my bite.

Hermes gave the lowdown, just before dawn
And told me we'd need to keep our heads on.

Then she brought me four seal skins to use 
Making sure we had no excuse. 
And since we had a rancid smell,
Ambrosia to our noses the goddess fell.

We each lay in a pit, covered in fur,
As we waited for the giant to slur. 
The stinky seals were driving us mad 
Thankfully, with ambrosia, we were glad!

Hey, listen up, let me tell you a tale
Of some guys who went and set a trap, no fail
They spent the morning watching seals sunbath
Until the old man showed up, on his path

He counted his seals, thought he was slick
Little did he know, he was about to get a nasty trick
With a shout, they seized him and he transformed, quick
Into a lion, dragon, wild boar, a tree, so sick

But they held on tight, didn't give up the chase
Until the old man broke down, couldn't keep up the pace
He asked what they wanted, started to plead his case
But they held steady, wouldn't give up, not even a space

He asked which god helped them hatch the plan
But they just laughed, they didn't give a damn
They wanted revenge, something they had to demand
And this old man, he couldn't even withstand

So let this be a lesson to all the trappers out there
If you're gonna set a trap, be sure to beware
The one who you catch might not be so rare
But someone who can transform on a dare. YOLO!

Dude, the struggle is real, man oh man
Stuck on this island, feeling like a castaway, I swear I can
No way to escape, my spirit's low, feeling quite blue
Oh wise one, tell me: which god is giving me the screw?
Moreover, guide my sails, tell me the way
So I can get the heck out of here and make it home someday.

Yo, listen up, sailor of the sea
If you wanna be with your homies, happy and free
You gotta make some sacrifices, it's the key
To please Jove and other gods, it's their decree

Before embarking, heed this advice
Offer holy hecatombs, and be precise
Only then you'll be in good favor and suffice
And finally return to Egypt to reunite with your tribe

The gods are mighty and don't take it lightly
So make sure you get it right and don't act slightly
If you want to finish your voyage brightly
And finally see your home and family tightly

In this world of legend and myth
It's important to keep the gods happy and with
Their blessings, you'll be able to smoothly lift
Yourself and your crew and finally shift

So, remember to make your offerings, it's a must
And the gods will be kind, that's a trust
In the end, you'll be happily reunited and adjust
With your own house, like the boomers' Frozen's Elsa, just.

Oh dang, my heart was shattered into two
When I heard I had to go to Egypt anew
But I sucked it up, said "alright, bet"
And asked if our folks all made it out yet

Did every single Achaean bro
Make it back home, all good to go?
Or did someone face an untimely fate
On their ship or with friends, too little too late?

'Oh snap, 'Son of Atreus,' he replied, 'are you sure you want to know how it goes down? Brace yourself, cuz my story is lit and it flows. Many of the bros you're asking for are no longer alive, but some made it back and are thriving. Only two of the top-notch leaders, who went with you, met their fate on the way home. As for that battle scene, you were there too, it was crazy, you know what I mean. This third Achaean leader is still chilling at sea, he's alive and well, but the sea's got him stuck. Ajax got damaged and Neptune sent him to the rocks of Gyrae; but Neptune spared his life and he could've made it, but then he started boasting and ruined it. He said he was un-drownable even for the gods to kill, so Neptune got mad and grabbed his trident to give a thrill. Neptune split the rock where Ajax was sitting and the sea swallowed him whole, and that was it.  So that bro, drank salt water and didn't make it.'

Yo, let me tell you about this G named Agamemnon  
He was on a voyage, with his bro and a ton  
And just when he thought he was out of the wind  
It picked up and took him for a spin  

Juno wasn't having it, she came through clutch  
Protected his brother, kept him out of a rut  
But then the wind got crazy and things got dicey  
They ended up at Thyeste's house, oh so pricey  

But the gods weren't done, they had one last trick  
They backed up the wind, made it nice and slick  
Our boy Agamemnon was finally home  
And he couldn't help but cry, tears start to foam  

He kissed the ground, so happy to be back  
All the gods had his back, that's a fact  
Agamemnon's story is a wild ride  
But he made it back safe, with the gods on his side.

"Hey, did y'all hear about this epic tale,
When Aegisthus plotted to make Agamemnon fail?
He promised his watchman two talents of gold,
To make sure that Agamemnon wouldn't be bold.
But when he saw him pass, he gave the green light,
And plotted his betrayal with all his might.
Ambushed with twenty of his bravest men,
Agamemnon fell for Aegisthus' evil plan.
He threw a grand feast which was all a facade,
For Agamemnon was caught in a death trap facade.
Foul play was Aegisthus' way of the day,
He butchered Agamemnon without any delay.
Not a follower alive, nor a soul left standing,
The cloisters were left with carnage so demanding." 👀

Yo Proteus spittin truth, made me feel it in my youth.
My heart's now shattered, my mind's scattered.
I sat on the sand, tears in my hand.
I didn't wanna see light, things weren't looking bright.
Old man of the sea said "Boy, stop cryin'; it's just useless whinin'."
Atreus' son, get up and run, cause Aegisthus is still havin' fun.
Orestes was quick, but you can still carry the stick.
Come back home, don't you roam, it's time for the funereal dome.

Oh my gosh, you wanna know about the third dude,
Was he lost at sea or just feeling blue? 
Tell me the truth, it won't make me rude,
Even if it's sad and makes me boo-hoo.

I'm here for you and all your sorrow,
Let's chat about it, don't need to borrow.
Is he out at sea, not knowing what to do?
Or has he left this world, to start anew?

Spill the tea, don't keep me waiting,
Let's talk about it, no hesitating.
I promise to be here, like a good pal,
So let's dig deep and reveal the tale.

But before that, let me reference a meme,
So we can make this story, like a fun dream.
"Tell me more about this man, please and thanks,"
As we unravel the details, like a bunch of pranks.

'The tea is hot, my dude,' cried I, showing off my attitude. 
Calypso got Ulysses, though, trapped on her island. 
His heart's filled with sorrow, feeling solo and stranded. 
He's got no transport or sailor crew to get him to his house. 
But for Menelaus, death is averted, and it's no rouse. 
Instead, gods will take him to Elysian plains. 
Rhadamanthus is king, and life there is far from mundane. 
In Elysium, never snow nor hail nor rain does fall. 
The West wind from Oceanus gives energy to all. 
All of this is coming because of Helen, his wife. 
Being Jove's son-in-law brings on this five-star afterlife.'

Yo, Odyssey, my bro!
This story's 'bout to blow!
He dived under the waves,
And left me to be brave.

I felt so much despair,
As I went with my whole squad,
Towards the ships, we had to prepare
To leave where we had trod.

When dawn broke, we were ready,
Our sails and masts were set steady.
We hit the sea with our oars,
And rowed towards the land of the bores.

I stopped by the stream of Egypt,
To offer hecatombs- so legit!
Just showing heaven that we were sorry,
For causing all that inner fury.

After raising a barrow for Agamemnon,
I went home with a quick run.
The gods were on my side,
And sent me a fair wind for the ride!

Hold up, wait a minute, let me put some hype up in it!
Odin's making moves that are quite significant,
He's offering you help, an extra ten days
So you can rest up and change your old ways.
A shiny chariot, three horses so fly,
And a chalice that'll make your drink-offering high.
You better act right and show some gratitude,
Or Odin might struggle with his attitude.
But let's focus on the blessings he's bestowed,
And appreciate the gifts on this epic road.
So drink to the gods, remember Odin's name,
And enjoy the life he's helped you reclaim. #blessed #grateful #sippinonthisjuice #thankyouodin

Oh wow, Telemachus, you're sounding pretty fly,
chatting away with the cunning Odysseus guy,
your conversations too lit, and time just flies by,
but your crew's getting restless and don't wanna lie.

Can't leave without a gift, that'd be us being impolite,
you want a plate while you leave the horses on site,
strolling around on the flat land, they'll be alright,
they'll munch on the lotus and maybe sleep all night.

Your home island, Ithaca, doesn't have much to show,
no racecourses or fields, just goats that make things slow,
but you like it that way, it makes the island glow,
in its own unique style, which other places don't know.

Menelaus was chill when he shook Telemachus's hand,
"You come from good stock," he said, about to expand,
"I can make this exchange, no need to demand,
I have the finest plate crafted by Vulcan's own hand.

It's a silver bowl, with its rim polished in gold,
A gift from Phaedimus, I got when I strolled,
In Sidon, on my homeward trip I had enrolled,
Take it as a present, it's a beauty to behold." 

You'll flex on your haters with this dope dish,
It's stunning and priceless, nobody will wish,
To mess with you, you'll be the coolest fish,
In any gathering, it'll be your special niche.

The king's house was lit, guests came in droves,
They brought sheep and wine, and their wives brought loaves.
The kitchen was busy, cooking up meals,
While they chatted 'bout life and how it feels.

The bread was abundant, carbs for days,
The wine flowed freely, toasting in many ways.
They laughed and joked, with no worries at hand,
No better feeling than good food and friends.

The sheep came too, so much meat to eat,
Grilling and roasting, a savory treat.
Conversation flowed, non-stop and chill,
Gossip, stories, all good vibes to feel.

They came and went, in a constant flow,
But the king's house party would never go slow.
Food, drinks, and laughs, they had it all,
A night to remember, all having a ball.

"Hey, yo, Antinous, what's the haps?
No need to act all high and mighty, perhaps?
Ulysses is gone, ain't no one in charge
But y'all gotta act like fools, oh so large?"

Antinous, with a sneer, then replied,
"Listen up, Noemon, ain't no need to chide
We can do what we want, when we want, where we please
And if you got a problem, then begone with the breeze."

But Noemon, unafraid, stood his ground,
"Y'all need to chill out, stop acting like clowns
Ulysses may be gone, but that don't give you the right
To wreak havoc and cause a constant fright."

Antinous and Eurymachus just laughed,
Saying "Oh please, Noemon, don't be daft
We'll do what we want, and that's just how it goes
So don't try to stop us with your feeble prose."

But little did they know, Ulysses was near,
And he wouldn't put up with their disrespectful jeers
The suitors better watch out, 'cause karma's a bore,
And with Ulysses back, they won't be in charge no more.

Oh dang, Antinous, do you know #WhenTelemachusReturnsFromPylos?
He took my ship and left me in some deep mental repose.
I need that ship to cross over to Elis real quick,
I got 12 brood mares with yearling mule foals, that's no trick.
I wanna bring one here and break him - that's my whole plan,
But I can't do it without that ship, man.

Oh my gosh, they heard the news
And couldn't believe their ears, I'm telling you
They thought Telemachus was just chillin' with the sheep
Or hanging out with the swine and taking a little sleep

Antinous was suspicious, he wanted the truth
"When did he leave?" he demanded with proof
"Who accompanied the boy on his trip?
Were they freestylers or just under his grip?"

"And hold up," he continued with a frown
"Did he take your ship or did you just give it up, like a clown?"
We need the facts, come on let's go
Spill the tea, we gotta know!

Oh dang, Noemon's got some explaining,
But he's not really to blame, he's just complying.
A man in a pickle, he couldn't refuse,
Lending money was something he didn't want to abuse.

Them young men who went with him, a fine bunch indeed,
Mentor, the captain, sounded like they'd succeed.
But wait, something's not right, here's a strange twist,
Mentor was seen here earlier, how did he board that ship? 

It's like a glitch in the matrix, déjà vu or something,
This story's making my head spin, it's a bit baffling.
But hey, let's not judge too soon,
Maybe there's an explanation that will be a boon.

Oh snap, Noemon went back to his crib! 
But Antinous and Eurymachus were not having it, they were so mad, it’s no fib. 
They told the others to come and take a seat, 
And when they did, Antinous began to vent his heat. 
His heart was black with rage, his eyes filled with fire, 
Like when SpongeBob burned down the Krusty Krab, it was dire.

Oh man, Telemachus, that guy's a riot,
Sailing off without anyone's quiet,
He's got an awesome crew that's been picked,
And now the gods are surely ticked.

Goodness gracious, this is not good,
Those gods will get him if they could,
But Telemachus won't back down,
He'll keep sailing until he's found.

Listen here, we need to get a ship,
With twenty dudes, it's gonna be lit,
We'll wait for him right by Ithaca,
When he sees us, he'll have a panic attack.

Oh snap, Telemachus will be in trouble,
He should have stuck to his daily bubble,
But now his journey will come to an end,
Oh wait, is that a Keanu Reeves trend?

Did you hear what he said, my bud?
It got the crowd all hyped, it must have been good.
They clapped and cheered, like they do at a show
Then they all went inside, ready to go.

They left the outside, and entered the hall
Ready to party, ready to ball.
It must have been lit, like a viral meme
Or a tweet that goes viral, like a dream.

I wish I was there, to be part of the crowd
And hear what he said, that made them so loud.
But instead I'm here, chillin' at my pad
Too bad I missed out, it makes me feel sad.

Hold up, Penelope ain't playin' around
She's wise to the suitors' plot she just found
Medon, the servant, heard 'em scheme and shout
He told Penelope what it was all about

Ugh, those suitors are so extra, it's no joke
They want the maids to cook and serve for these blokes
Penelope's done with their wooing and dining spree
They're wasting her son's estate, can't they see?

Ulysses was a good dude, he treated folks kind
Never spoke harshly or with a high-handed mind
Kings can be hard sometimes and play favorites too
But Ulysses never did wrong, and that's true.

Penelope's got a point, those suitors must be cray
They're trying to win her love in a disrespectful way
No gratitude left in this world, for real tho
Can't blame Penelope for feeling so low.

#facts #datruth #grateful #respect #penelopethequeen #loyalty #notworthy #iseeyou #badhearts #extramuch #suitorsneedtostop #ulyssesforpresident #greekmyths #litAF #millennialassistant

Whoa, hold up, what did you just say?
They're gonna murder Telemachus, no way!
Medon spilled the beans, it's true, true, true,
But we gotta do something, what can we do?

Telemachus, on his way home all alone,
But those bad guys definitely won't atone,
We gotta warn him, let him know, quick!
Before those meanies make their nasty trick.

Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he's been for the deets,
But we gotta interrupt him from his fleet,
Medon, you legend, you spilled the tea,
Now we gotta let Telemachus see.

Let's hustle and bustle, and make some moves,
Before Telemachus gets the blues,
We gotta do this, it's not even funny,
Quick, someone call the squad - this isn't about money!

Oh dang Penelope, that's rough,
It's natural to feel sad and tough,
Your son, he sailed away,
Long voyages, seems like yesterday,
But don't you worry, let me tell you,
He's doing great, like Pikachu. 
He's the hero of his own story,
Sailing seas, in search of glory,
Just wait till he comes back,
You'll be proud, like a TikTok snack. 
His name will live on forever,
Like Drake on charts, strong and clever,
So don't you have any fear,
Your son is a legend, let that be clear.

Yo Medon, you better own
Your boy Telemachus, he's grown
Wondering if his pops is gone
Or alive and coming home

Did a god push him to roam
Or was it just his own dome
Telemachus on a mission
To seek the truth in his vision

Is Odysseus out there livin'
Or has he met his final given
This journey will test his skill
To discover what's real, not just chill

Some think he's too young for this task
But Telemachus is up to the ask
He'll use his skills and all his might
To find the answer and make it right

All we can do is watch and cheer
As Telemachus faces his greatest fear
May the gods be with him on this trip
As we wait for him to give us the tip. #HomerWho #TelemachusTheRealHero

"Y'all, this drama's getting too much,
Penelope's crying, it's real tough!
She can't sit, her heart just can't take it,
Flopping on the floor, her grief naked.

And all the maids in the house so loyal,
Joining in, they're all so royal.
Their tears just flow like a river,
All of them wailing, the scene a quiver.

But can you blame them? The pain's too harsh,
Penelope can't hold on, breaks like parched.
This tale's gripping, it's hard to bear,
But we're hooked, can't help but to stare."

Oh my gosh, my dear Penelope,
Your story has left me feeling so yucky.
First, losing your husband so brave,
Now, not knowing if your son can be saved.

You asked your hussies to give you a call,
But they didn't even give you a heads up at all.
Girl, that's so not cool, it's lame,
They should be ashamed!

But don't you worry, there's still some hope,
You should call up that gardener, Dolius, 'cause he knows the scope.
Tell Laertes everything that you know,
And he'll help you come up with a plan, fo real tho.

We'll show those haters who's boss,
And make sure they know who really pays the cost.
So stay strong, and don't lose your fire,
We've got this, let's take them down to the wire! 

#DoliusTheGardener #LaertesHasAPlan #GirlPower #TeamPenelope #StayStrong

Heyo, Madam, don't you cry,
I've got the scoop, don't ask me why.
I knew it all, his bread and wine,
But he made me swear, it's been some time.
Wash your face, and change your dress,
Take your maids and pray, don't stress.
To Minerva, that's the move,
She's the one who can improve.
Don't go to Laertes, let him be,
Can't think the gods'll take the family.
I'm sure there will be a son,
To come up after him and get things done.

Hold up, wait just a sec,
Penelope's not ready to wreck.
She's feeling down, shedding tears,
But her assistant's here to calm her fears.

A few encouraging words and she's feeling fly,
Her tears wiped, she's ready to give this another try.
Washing her face and changing her clothes,
Penelope's now ready to strike a pose.

Grabbing some barley to make an offering,
She begins praying to her goddess for something.
With determination in her eyes,
She's ready to take on any surprise.

Minerva better listen to this call,
'Cause Penelope's not gonna fall.
With her maids by her side,
She's ready to take on this ride.

Yo, Athena, goddess divine,
Don't let the suitors cross the line.
Remember all those times Ulysses
Burned you fat thighs with no stresses.

Save Telemachus, Penelope's boy,
From their schemes and evil ploy.
Let his mother's pleas be heard,
And don't let their plans go undeterred.

Athena, queen of wisdom and guile,
Don't let their plans go off in style.
Protect the prince, save his fate,
And leave the suitors to their hate. 

#SorryNotSorry, but she's just being honest,
Help her out, don't be modest.

"Yo, Athena's gotta respond, we need her care! These suitors all up in here, making a fuss like a bear. 
Trying to win Penelope with their wealth and charm, they must be unaware,
That she's waiting for her love to come back, the great Odysseus, where?
But let's be real, they don't stand a chance,
Their schemes are as flimsy as a plastic fake plant. 
Penelope's love is strong like Keanu Reeves,
And her heart is not for sale, unlike Supreme tees.
So suitors, back off, let her be,
Odysseus is coming home, just you wait and see."

Hold up, hold up, let me break it down
The queen is plannin' to tie the knot in town
But, oh snap, she don't know what's up
Her son's fate has been sealed, that's rough

It's like a modern-day Game of Thrones
With all these secrets and unknowns
The queen's oblivious to the truth
Her son's future, yeah it's aloof

In the midst of all this royal drama
We can't forget that karma's a comma 
What goes around sure comes back
The queen's gonna feel the heat, that's a fact

So let's get lit and watch this story unfold
We'll laugh, we'll cry, and we might even scold
But one thing's for sure, we'll be hooked
On this royal family and all that's cooked. 

#WinterIsComing? Nah, It's Royal Marriage Time! 🤴💍👸

Yo, Antinous spoke, let's not be loud,  
Lest we disturb the peace, don't be proud.  
We're all on the same page, don't you know?  
Let's move in silence and let our actions show.  

Mum's the word, no need to shout out,  
Ain't no need to stress, no need to pout.  
We're lowkey, we're cool, we're lit,  
Our plan's gonna work, just wait for it.  

We move as one, in solemn silence,  
Our minds are keen, we ain't no nonsense.  
Antinous leads us, he's the man,  
We follow him 'cause he's got the plan.  

So let's keep it down, let's keep it cool,  
We won't let anyone act like a fool.  
Our actions speak louder than our talk,  
We slay all day, we don't need to squawk.

Okay, so these twenty men,
Got their ship into the den,
They twisted leather like mad,
And set the sails they had.

Their armor was shiny and bright,
Like it sparkled through the night,
Then they anchored their ship in place,
And had supper at a leisurely pace.

They chilled on the shore,
Waiting for night to be more,
Then they'd set sail to explore,
Like some internet lore.

These guys sure do know,
How to put on a good show,
Just like my fave meme,
That's always on the scene.

Yo, Penelope was feeling so down,
All she could do was lay there with a frown,
Thinking 'bout her son that was so brave,
And wondering if he'd survive or be slayed.

Like a lioness trapped in a cage,
With no escape, just anger and rage,
Penelope's mind was in a mix,
And all she could do was count the ticks.

But then she fell asleep with ease,
And dreamed about Ulysses' deeds,
How he would come and save the day,
And scare off those suitors, no delaying!

So Penelope slept the night away,
Hoping that her son would win the fray,
And wake up to a new morning,
Where they could all live life without mourning.

"Girl, don't be trippin', wipe them tears,
'Cause Minerva's here, to calm your fears.
Iphthime's talkin', in case you forgot,
She sent me here, to help you out a lot.

Ulysses is homeward bound, don't you know?
He's on his way, from that crazy flow.
Oh girl, you gotta be strong, and stay lit,
Just trust the gods, and believe in it.

You a queen, girl, don't forget it,
Penelope's the name, you gotta rep it.
Hold your head high, and show 'em what's right,
'Cause in the end, you're gonna win the fight.

Now, dry them tears, and fix that hair,
'Cause Ulysses is almost there.
Girl, you got this, just stay true,
And in no time, you'll be happy and through." 

And with that, the vision disappeared, 
And Penelope felt much less weird.
She knew she had to keep the faith,
And trust that Ulysses would be safe.

Yo, Penelope, don't you weep,
The gods got your back, just go to sleep.
Your son will return, don't be mad,
They won't let anything bad happen, it's lit, it's rad.
The gods are chill and have no beef,
They won't let your heart suffer, that's their belief.
So just relax and trust the divine plan,
Your son will be back, it's guaranteed, fam.

Yo, Penelope, why you crying for?
Your man was legendary, a hero to the core.
Your son's away, but don't fret, he's strong
He'll come back to ya, you know it won't be long.

I get it, girl, you miss them bad
But don't let it make you sad.
Stay positive and keep your head up high
And trust in the gods to keep your loved ones nigh.

Your son's a sailor, and that's pretty rad
But I know you worry, 'cause the ocean can be mad.
Just pray to Poseidon, and he'll keep him safe
And bring your boy back to you, with no trace of disgrace.

And when he's home, you can play some Fortnite
And bond over some memes, it'll be a delight
Don't worry, girl, your family will be fine
Just keep your chin up, and everything will align.

Oh snap, Athena's got your back,
Her compassion for you will never slack.
The vision said, "Hey, don't be dismayed",
She sent me to bring you aid. 

Minerva's with you, side by side,
With her, you have nothing to hide.
She's a goddess, a fierce ally,
Sending her vision, she'll never lie. 

Take heart, my friend, the goddess stands strong,
Her power will lift you all along.
So don't fret, just keep on going,
With Athena's help, you'll keep glowing. 

In the face of adversity, don't let it win,
With Athena's strength, you'll surely grin.
Her power will guide you to victory,
And bring you to your glory story.

"Whoa there, Penelope, calm down don't get mad,
I'm just here to tell you what's good and what's bad.
To answer your question, that poor chap is still breathing,
But his life has been no easy achieving.

He's been through the wringer, that's for sure,
And his journey has been anything but a blur.
But don't you worry, he's quite the survivor,
No matter how much his foes try to depriver.

As for whether he's alive or dead in the ground,
Well that's a question that cannot be unwound.
Only the gods have the power to decree,
Whether his fate lies in the land of the free.

But for now, just know he's still hanging in there,
And his story is one that you'll surely declare,
As one of the most epic tales ever told,
That'll leave your heart warm and your mind bold."

Oh snap, this situation sounds kind of bleak,
Like a meme that's been reposted for a week.
But don't worry, don't let your heart sink,
I'll hype it up and make it lit in a blink.

The vision's speaking in a way that's droll,
But don't worry, don't throw in the towel.
It ain't no use to keep asking the dead,
So stop talking now, and go ahead.

Let's turn this dullness into something dope,
Like a viral tweet that won't forget to cope.
So hit that like and retweet button fast,
And make this moment truly last.

Oh my gosh, yo, check out Penelope's dream
It's crazier than it may seem!
She woke up feeling so refreshed,
Her nightmare left her oh so blessed.

Dissipated into thin air,
Her dream went away without a care.
But it was so vivid and real,
It made her happy, it made her feel.

Like, "Thank goodness that was just a dream!"
Penelope got a good night's sleep, it seems.
And now she's ready to start the day,
Let's hope it stays that way!

Hold up, y'all gotta hear this tale
Of Telemachus and the attackers who set sail
These suitors had a plan, oh so heinous
To murder our boy, it was truly outrageous

But little did they know, Telemachus was clever
He wasn't just gonna sit there, no never
He set off on a journey, bold and brave
To find his father, and hopefully save

As the suitors set off, feeling oh so sly
Telemachus remained focused, with no reason to lie
He made his way to that rocky isle
Where the attackers waited with a sneaky smile

But little did they know, our boy was wise
He had a plan, to take them all by surprise
In the end, it was the suitors who were doomed
Telemachus had outsmarted them, and they were consumed

So remember this story, when you're feeling blue
Just be like Telemachus, and stick true
Because even in the face of danger and strife
You can emerge victorious, and take back your life. #Homer #Odysseyjokes #GenZ #Lit

Ayo, let me tell you 'bout a story
That's gonna make you feel so glory
It's filled with drama, suspense, and shade
And trust me, it's not gonna fade

So, I was scrolling through my feed 
When I saw something, made me proceed 
It was a tweet that said "OMG"
And let me tell you, it wasn't phony 

I clicked on the link, didn't know what to expect 
But what I found was my respect 
This story was truly lit
And I couldn't help but admit 

It had all the things that made a story great 
From plot twists to characters that could relate 
And the memes, oh boy, they were on fleek 
I was laughing so hard, I nearly leaked 

So, if you want something that's fire 
And will make you feel inspired 
Check out this story, don't miss out 
Trust me, it's worth the clout.

BOOK V

Y'all know it's gonna be fire,  
When Minerva starts to talk about Ulysses' desire  
She tells the gods 'bout his sufferings and pains,  
And how Calypso's love has him in chains  

Jove, the lord of thunder, he hears it all,  
Thinking about how to answer the goddess' call  
While Tithonus rises, ready for the day,  
Jove and his crew listen to what she has to say  

Minerva, she's got them fully informed,  
'bout Ulysses' woes, from which he cannot be returned  
Calypso's hold, she's really got him hooked,  
Our boy's in deep, he cannot be overlooked  

But the gods have a plan, that much is clear,  
They'll work together, Ulysses has nothing to fear  
So don't trip, we'll come through in a flash,  
Just watch us, y'all, we'll turn the situation into cash!

Yo, Father Jove, and all you other gods above,
I hope y'all never send a ruler who's kind and loves,
No more equity, let's make them all cruel and unjust,
'Cause no one remembers Ulysses, their leader they discuss.

He's stuck on an island with a nymph named Calypso,
Who ain't letting him leave, and boy, it's been quite a while since so,
He can't find any ships or sailors to sail,
Back to his own country, it's such a fail.

Not to mention, some people want to murder his son,
Telemachus, who's coming back, but the journey's not fun,
He's been to Pylos and Lacedaemon to get news,
About his father's whereabouts; it's such a huge bruise. 

#SorryNotSorry if the story's sad,
But it's not my fault that it's this bad,
Our man Ulysses needs your divine intervention,
To make his journey back home without any more tension.

"Excuse you, pops, but you clearly forgot," she said with a toss of her hair, "Sending Telemachus out there was always so unfair. But fine, since you don't get it, let me make it crystal clear. I sent him on this quest, hoping he'd learn to persevere. And don't worry, daddy-o, I'll protect him without any fear." She popped a peace sign and added, "The suitors will come back, with no victory to cheer, because their hapless strategies were weak, like that one time when Drake tried to sing while sick, the results were clear."

Yo Mercury, listen up, it's time to get hype,
We need a message sent, and you're just the type.
Head to Calypso and give her the news,
She's gotta let Ulysses choose.

No gods or men will follow his trail,
He's gotta ride a raft, through a perilous gale.
Twenty days will he traverse the sea,
Until he lands in Phaeacia, where he'll finally be.

These kin to gods will treat him right,
Like he's one of them, their delight.
A ship they'll give him, to sail home,
With treasure to make a Pharaoh foam.

More gold, bronze and raiment than he could amass,
From all his prize money at the end of the Trojan clash.
This is how it's done, this is how he'll return,
To his dear homeland, his heart's yearn. 

And now, Mercury, off you go,
And tell Calypso what she needs to know.
With your speed, it won't take long,
To get this messenger's job done like a pro. 

Yolo!

Yo, this story's 'bout a dude so bold,
A hero with a tale worth being told.
Mercury, the guide, slayer of Argus,
Was swift as a bullet, powerful and robust.

With sandals of gold, he took to the sky,
Flying with ease - this guy could really fly!
In his hand, he held a wand so sly,
Sleeping men he'd wake, winking his eye.

He flew over land, sea and foam,
Even past waves where cormorants roam.
He travelled far, never losing sight,
Til he landed on an isle of might.

Calypso was the nymph he had to meet,
Living in a cave, paradise so sweet.
This was the quest he had to complete,
But as always, it wasn't going to be neat.

Yo, he found her at home, all on her own,
She was a weavin' her loom, her talent shown.
The fire was lit, cedar and sandalwood scent,
Smellin' so good, like a candle that's heaven sent.

She sang while she worked, her voice so sweet,
Birds flew around, can't accept defeat.
Owls, hawks, and sea-crows, making their sounds,
All in one place, their home so profound.

The cave was covered, in trees so lush,
A vine with grapes, all ripe to crush.
Four running rills of water, a sight to see,
Doused the violets and herbage, you can be.

Mercury stopped, looked at the view,
Couldn't help but to adore, feels so new,
The god couldn't help but go inside,
To enjoy the beauty, can't hide. 

#lit #weave #scentedcandle #nature #godsamongus #beauty #vineyard #flowingwater #birdwatching #cave#mercury #Greekmyths #mythology.

Yo, Calypso knew him from the start
For the gods, it's not hard to play their part
Ulysses, though, wasn't around
He was at the beach with tears he found
Mercury got a seat from the goddess
She was happy since his visit wasn't a mess
"Why have you come?" she asked with love
"I'll do it now, just name your goal above"
"Come in, refreshments I'll provide
Let's sit and chat, don't let it slide."

Oh dang, this ambrosia is sick, it's got me feeling so quick! 
This red nectar is lit, can't lie, it's a perfect fit. 
But hold up, wait a minute, let me catch my breath, 
Because this moment is way too lit to forget. 

Mercury took a sip and felt alive,
The taste was so good, he had to high-five! 
This ambrosia is the key to immortality,
It's so bomb, it's practically a reality.

And don't even get me started on the red nectar,
It gives me energy like an electric vector. 
My taste buds are jumping with joy,
I feel like a kid with a brand new toy.

Mercury shook his head in amazement,
This food was too good to not make a statement. 
He thanked her for the meal with a grin,
And then flew off into the beyond, feeling like a champ, win-win!

Oh my goodness, gods and goddesses galore,  
This guy's telling a tale, let me give you some more.  
Just listen up, he was sent by Jove,  
And we all know crossing him, you better be above.  

He didn't wanna come, it was an order in fact,  
But his divine duties, he couldn't retract.  
This man he speaks of, he's so ill-starred,  
Fought in a war, came home, and things went hard.  

He and his crew, they made a grave mistake,  
Against Minerva, they were in a losing shake.  
She made wind and waves, to cause disaster,  
Leaving just one man to survive the aftermath faster.  

So now he's here, far from his own kin,  
But Jove's got a decree which he wants to begin.  
Let this poor soul go back to his own place,  
And see his friends, his land, his face.

"Y'all gods need to chill, seriously," Calypso raged, her anger set afire,
"Always jealous when us goddesses take a mortal as our desire.
When Dawn got busy with Orion, you flipped out, acting like drama queens,
And when Ceres hooked up with Iasion, you killed him with your godly means.
And now you're mad at me just 'cause I found a guy I liked,
I rescued him from the shipwreck, saw he survived.
I loved him and wanted him to be immortal, it's true,
But I can't go against Jove, I've got better things to do.
If he insists on leaving, I won't stop him, though it breaks my heart,
But I'll give him advice, try and make sure he won't fall apart.
I can't send him myself, so he'll have to find his own way,
But I gotcha, boo, I'mma help him out, so he can make it through the day."

Oh snap, Mercury's got jokes  
Sending folks away like it's no big hoax  
Jove's not playing, he'll punish you with wrath  
Better listen up, he's the big boss in this path  

Mercury's chill, but he means business for sure  
Don't wanna mess up and make Jove impure  
Sending someone away might be hard to do  
But disobeying Jove is so not cool  

So take heed, my peeps, and do what's right  
Or you might end up facing Jove's powerful might  
Mercury's warning is no laughing matter  
Don't wanna end up like a Twitter hashtag, #scatter

Yo Ulysses, I heard the news,
Jove's message to you ain't no ruse.
You've been here with me for so long,
But I know that you wanna go home.

You're crying tears and feeling so down,
It's like you're always wearing a frown.
You're sick of this island and me,
And you want to be where you're meant to be.

You spend your days by the sea,
Wishing that you could feel free.
But let me be clear, my dear,
You won't find freedom here.

I know you miss your wife and child,
It's time to go back and be reconciled.
It's time to leave this paradise,
And return to your own slice of life.

So pack your bags, it's time to leave,
The world outside is waiting for thee.
Don't be sad, don't you cry,
Just say your goodbyes and fly high.

Now let's go, don't be shy,
Your adventure is waiting, don't ask why.
And remember, when you're feeling blue,
You'll always have Calypso, that's true.

"Ay homie, no more frownin' in this townin' 
I'm finna help you bounce, no more lookin' downin'
We'll send you off, but not in a coffin
Build a lit raft, with an upper deck poppin'

I'll pack it with bread, water and wine
So you don't starve on your way to cloud nine
Some clothes too, so you can look fresh
Hope the gods bless your journey, that'd be the best

They know what's up, they got the power
To send a fair wind and make it a shower
Of blessings on blessings, on your voyage to home
A trip so fly, it'll make you never wanna roam."

Ulysses, my dude, chill out for a sec,
Your reaction to the goddess, disrespect.
She's offering you a way back to Ithaca town,
Don't be so quick to bring her down.

But I get it, taking a raft is not ideal,
Especially if you want to safely seal the deal.
But hear me out, bro, she knows what's best,
And wants to help you pass this daunting test.

I know it sounds risky, I won't even lie,
But trust in the goddess, don't ask why.
She's on your side, she's got your back,
Swear that she won't hurt you, that's the tack.

So pack your bags, and let's set sail,
We'll make it there, and you'll prevail.
Don't worry about the journey, it'll be fine,
Just trust the goddess, and we'll be in Ithaca in no time.

(YOLO, amirite?)

Yo, Calypso spittin' facts,
Caressin' him with gentle acts,
"You wrong, boy," she says to him,
With an oath so strong, it's a win.

May Heaven above and earth below,
With Styx's waters, can't you know?
I swear I mean you no harm, no way,
Just advice for the island getaway.

I'm dealin' straight up, no lies here,
My heart's not made of iron, clear?
I'm sorry for you, no need to fear,
Calypso's got you, have no fear.

"Hey there Ulysses, you're finally awake!
I hope the food I served you wasn't fake.
I know you're probably missing your wife,
But I'll keep you company, that's just life.

I have ambrosia and nectar as my own cuisine,
But for mortals, I serve what they have seen.
I know you have to leave, it's such a tease,
But I'll make sure you leave here with ease.

I couldn't help but notice, you're such a snack,
I'm sorry, I know that's a bit of a hack.
But seriously, your looks are on fleek,
It's no wonder why you're so unique.

Stay with me forever, it'll be so lit,
We'll Netflix and chill, it's worth a bit.
I'll treat you like a king, just trust in me,
Together we can rule the galaxy."

Yo Ulysses, son of Laertes, you wanna head home straightaway?
Good luck and all, but lemme just say,
If you only knew the hardships ahead,
Stay with me instead,
I'll make you immortal, you'll never die,
Forget about that wife, don't you even try.
I'm just sayin', don't expect her to match,
My beauty's on point, like that savage cat scratch.
No mortal woman can compare with me,
You're welcome to stay with my divinity.

Yo, Ulysses, don't be alarmed 
I know your wife Penelope can’t charm 
Like a goddess, tall and divine 
But crossing seas, she's not worth the dime 

Don’t worry, I’ll hype up your tale 
From troubles, you cannot bail 
If some god decides to knock you 
You'll still slay, and we'll applaud you 

Infinite trouble you've faced 
By land and sea, no time to waste 
You're ready to take on this test 
And rise above like the very best 

So keep going, keep fighting 
The end is near, your journey exciting 
We'll root for you, our favorite Greek 
To get home, and success, you'll seek! #Blessed #GreekMythology #KeepFighting

As the sun took its leave and the dark did embark,  
The duo retreated to the back of the park  
And as the night drew in, they got ready for bed,  
Laid down their heads and rested their tired heads.  

No need for a tent, they had this cave instead,  
They got comfy and cozy, ready to hit the hay,  
But little did they know what would happen next in this app,  
Something epic was about to go down, like that Drake snap.

As Dawn's fingertips kissed the sky,
Ulysses got dressed, not a single shy.
In a dress light like a feather,
Calypso looked stunning, almost like she's from another weather.

Thinking of a way to speed his fate,
She gave him bronze axe that was first rate.
Sharpened on both sides and oh so fine,
With an olive-wood handle, it was totally divine.

She provided him with a sharp adze,
Showing him where the largest trees blaze.
He cut poplar, pine and oak,
All seasoned well, perfect for a sailor's folk.

After twenty trees cut down, he adzed them smooth,
Squaring them by rule in a perfect groove.
Calypso came back with augers to bore,
And so, they built a raft by the shore.

Fitted the timbers with bolts and rivets,
Making it broad and the beams have no limits.
A yard arm mast was not missed,
A rudder to steer and a deck in the midst.

As a protection from the waves' motion,
The raft was fenced with wicker as an ocean notion.
The sails were made with Calypso's linen,
All fastened with braces, enough to make you grinnin'.

And as the crowning touch to his rolling throne,
He drew the raft down the ocean with levers unknown.

Ulysses, the great sailor man,
Traveled across the ocean span.
But stranded now on Calypso's isle,
His heart was down, he lost his smile.

For four long days, he worked with might,
And finished his raft by day and night.
Calypso washed him up so clean,
And gave him clothes, like a cool teen.

And for his journey, she gave him wine,
Filled to the brim, it was so fine.
A bigger bag of water, she gave him quick,
And a wallet full of food, did the trick.

The wind was fair and warm for him,
As Ulysses' journey was about to begin.
He watched the Pleiads with all his might,
And Bootes late-setting under starry night.

Ulysses sailed skillfully day and night,
Guided by rudder, he was quite a sight.
He never closed his eyes, he was wide-awake,
Keeping to the left, the bear doesn't shake.

Seven and ten days did Ulysses ride,
Over the vast sea, with the wind by his side.
On the eighteenth day, the mountains did appear,
The Phaeacians' land was ever so near.

With the shield-like mountains in his sight,
Ulysses was filled with sheer delight.

Yo Neptune, just got back from the Ethiopians,
Saw Ulysses sailing, and it was vexin',
This dude's been in all sorts of calamities,
But now he's headed to Phaeacians, such veracity.

The gods changed their minds while I was away,
And Ulysses is close to reaching their bay,
But don't think he'll make it out unscathed,
Plenty of trouble ahead, feeling quite depraved.

It's like that meme where the car hits someone,
Ulysses keeps getting into trouble for fun,
But like a true hero, he'll fight until the end,
And all his obstacles he will transcend.

Yo, listen up, this is quite a tale,
Ulysses on a ship, braving the gale.
He grasped his trident, stirred up the sea,
Sending every wind to create a catastrophe.

From East, South, North, and West they came,
And Ulysses' heart filled with fear and shame.
"I'm in trouble," he said to himself in dismay,
"Calypso was right, the sea is my foe today."

Jove blackened the sky with his clouds,
And the winds raised the sea, strong and proud.
Ulysses feared for his life, safe to perish,
Regretting he wasn't in Troy, with the Danaans to cherish.

If only he had died that day,
When Achilles' body on the ground did lay,
A proper burial and honourable fame,
But now his life is at stake, a pitiable shame.

Dude, Ulysses was in for a ride
The waves attacked with a force he couldn't abide
The hurricane was so strong it broke the mast
And sent Ulysses flying, like a shipwreck cast

Underwater he struggled, clothes weighing him down
But Ulysses didn't falter or drown
He spat out the seawater that tasted so bitter
And swam towards his raft, with movements like a jitter

With determination he climbed on board, avoiding the deep
The sea played rough, tossing his raft like a game of keep
It spun Ulysses around, like thistledown in the wind
But he wouldn't give up, not even a bit chagrined

All around, the winds played their own game, passing the raft between them
But Ulysses held on, as the sea raged and condemned
This hero wasn't going to let the ocean defeat him
With steadfast resilience, he fought and didn't dim

In the end, Ulysses emerged triumphant, surviving the stormy fight
And proved to us all, that with courage and might
We can overcome the greatest obstacles in our path
And make it through, even when we're feeling the ocean's wrath. 

#notallheroes wear capes #oceanadventures #battlingthewaves #survivor #nevergiveup

Dang, Ulysses was in a tight spot
But then Ino, real OG, saw he needed the help that she's got
She once was human, now she's a marine goddess by fate 
And saw Ulysses struggling, had to intervene and help him escape
Rose up like a sea-gull from the waves so chill 
And took a seat on the raft, determined to keep him from a watery spill

"Yo, my brotha, why is Neptune so mad at you? He's causing chaos, but babe, don't you worry, he ain't gonna slay you. You seem like a smart dude, so listen to me, strip down and let your raft sail away with the breeze, swim to the Phaecian coast and you'll be in the clear, you'll see. And wait up, take my veil and wrap it round your chest, this enchantment will protect you, put your mind to rest. Once you hit land, fling it far into the ocean blue, and continue on your journey anew." With her words so wise, she passed him her magical veil, then dove outta sight like a bird, this girl was no frail.

Yo, Ulysses was in quite the perplexity
He thought, "Is this a god trying to wreck me?"
Saying to leave his raft, to quit and flee
But he knew better, as smart as can be

"I'll stick to my raft, her timbers still strong
Won't leave just yet for the land she said I belong
Still quite the distance, I'll face the throng
And only swim when my raft is no longer long"

So Ulysses remained steadfast and true
Resisting the temptations, a smart move to pursue
And when the time comes, he'll know what to do
Whether to swim or float, his decisions anew

Yo, Ulysses was stuck in a bind,  
Feeling torn between heart and mind.  
But Neptune wasn't down to wait,  
He brought a wave to seal his fate. 

The raft was wrecked, no hope in sight,  
But Ulysses refused to go down without a fight.  
He got up on a plank, feeling brave,  
And rode the waves like he was on a big rave. 

He shed his clothes, got ready to swim,  
Tied the veil tight under his limbs.  
He dived in, ready for the long haul,  
Hoping to find safety down the shore. 

King Neptune watched with a wry smile,  
Said to himself, "Let's wait awhile.  
This won't be easy, he's in for a ride,  
But let him swim till he finds the other side." 

With a heavy heart and a weary mind,  
Ulysses swam, leaving death behind.  
Towards the horizon he strove,  
Hoping to make friends with those who grove. 

Neptune drove away, content and pleased,  
For now, his heart was finally appeased.  
Ulysses battle had just begun,  
But he had the strength of a thousand suns.

Oh dang, Minerva's got Ulysses' back,
Stopping all the winds except one track,
She let a North breeze blow oh so strong,
So our boy Ulysses could reach his safe home.

She's like a boss, controlling Mother Nature,
One look from her and even winds can't betray ya,
Now Ulysses is cruising through the sea,
Feeling hype like he's earned royalty.

The land of the Phaeacians is where he's headed,
He must be relieved he's not stranded and dreaded,
Thanks to Minerva he's almost there,
Safe and sound with no need to despair.

Our girl Minerva knows what time it is,
She's unstoppable like the internet biz,
So let's all flex like her and be unstoppable too,
Like a boss who knows just what to do.

Ulysses was in a tough spot, adrift with no hope,
The waves were high and he was left to cope.
For two long days and nights he drifted on the sea,
With no sight of land, feeling lost and lonely.

But on the third day, a miracle happened,
The wind calmed down and he saw land beckon.
Ulysses swam with all his strength and might,
To set his feet on solid ground that night.

But the sea was rough and the rocks were high,
The waves crashed hard with a thunderous cry.
No harbours or shelters that could save his ship,
He was left with nothing but the land and mountain tips.

Still, Ulysses didn't give up, he pushed through,
Just like we do when we have a goal in view.
He fought his way through the rocky shore,
And finally found safety, his journey was no more. 

It's just like that meme, when you feel so lost,
But suddenly you find your way, no matter the cost.
Ulysses landed on the shore, like a boss,
And proved to us all, that even in waves, we can't get tossed.

Yo, Ulysses was feeling real blue,
After such a long swim, he saw land, woo!
But the coast was harsh, with no good sight,
No footing on the rocks, everything so tight.

He was afraid he'd be thrown so bad,
Against the rocks that were oh so sad,
If he dared to leave the water so grand,
Oh gee, he just wanted to find dry land!

But if he swam further in search of hope,
Nature might just say, "Hey man, nope!"
With waves and winds and monsters to face,
No wonder he's feeling in a wild chase.

But don't worry Ulysses, don't be afraid,
You've got this, don't be dismayed.
Just keep going and don't give in,
You'll make it to the shore and you'll win!

As he was stuck between the reefs,
His fate seemed to cause him griefs.
Caught by the waves, smacked by the rocks,
His journey showed many paradox.

Good thing Minerva appeared,
His fate, she had instantly cleared.
He held onto the rocks with might,
Waiting 'til the wave takes flight.

However, this wasn't the end,
The tide pulled him away, no time to spend.
Like a polypus sucker to bed,
His hands, torn and bleeding, feeling dead.

The rocks tore his skin with sheer power,
As the waves carried him far like a tower.
He was dragged deep, deep underwater,
A scene that left him breathless, like no other!

Ulysses was in deep despair,
But Minerva came to help and care.
He swam and swam, his fate not clear,
But kept his wits amidst his fear.

He looked for a haven or a spit,
To shield him from waves that wouldn't quit.
Then he found a river mouth,
Where no rocks stirred, just a gentle south.

He felt a current, cold and strong,
But knew he couldn't wait for long.
He prayed to the gods above,
For a chance to catch his breath and move.

And with their might, they led him true,
Towards a land that's bright and new.
Ulysses knew his journey's far,
But he'll keep going like a shooting star.

Oh, snap! Listen up, King, whoever you might be,
I'm in deep water and I'm calling out prayerfully.
I got lost at sea, and now I'm in distress,
Please Neptune, save me, I'm in a hot mess!

I'm reaching out, straight to your stream,
Hoping for mercy, like a millennial's dream.
I'm here on my knees, riverhood, begging for aid,
Don't let me down, King, I'm in need of this crusade. 

I'm just a mere mortal, lost at sea,
But with your expertise, I know I can flee.
So please, have some sympathy for me,
And grant me mercy, your humble suppliant, OK?

Bro, listen up, this tale's not done
Ulysses, tired and swollen, almost won
He was saved by a goddess, Ino was her name
A scarf of hers kept him from going down in fame

The river was mad, the waves were high
Ulysses had to swim, had to give it a try
But Ino saw him struggling, gasping for air
So she calmed the water, helped him out of there

Ino gave him a scarf, to keep him safe and dry
Ulysses was grateful, and he let out a sigh
But the sea had taken its toll, he couldn't stand
So he fell to the ground, washed up onto the sand

He tossed Ino's scarf back into the sea
It floated gently, gracefully, like a bee
Ino caught it, with a wave so fine
She smiled and thought, "He'll do just fine"

Ulysses rested, feeling warm and free
Thankful that he was back on solid ground, you see
He kissed the earth, so bountiful and rich
And that's how he got saved, without a glitch!

Bro, he sat on the riverbed, feeling so low,
Wondering how it'll all end, feeling so woe.
Staying here through the night, oh what a plight
Cold and damp, could make him end with a fright.

But if he climbs the hill, in search of a thrill,
Finds a thicket, and takes shelter at will,
Resting there for the night, away from the fight,
A good sleep guaranteed, under stars shining bright.

But wait, a savage beast, could make his relief, 
Into a tragedy, that's beyond belief,
Could make him a feast, before he could cease,
And put an end to his life, and steal his peace.

So now what's he to do, dude needs a clue,
To fight or to escape, to stay or to pursue?
The choice is up to him, to sink or to swim,
But beware bro, 'cos life is no whim.

As he pondered his choices, and listened for noises,
He sees a meme, that brings him new choices,
"YOLO," it reads with a hashtag so bold,
Life is short, live it up, before you get old.

Yo, Ulysses found the woods he sought,
A spot where two olive branches were caught,
One grafted and one a sucker free,
Together they formed a dense canopy.

No squally wind nor sun too bright,
Could pierce the cover which seemed just right,
Ulysses crawled under that olive tree,
And began to make himself a bed of leaves with glee.

The place was a mess, dead leaves everywhere,
But Ulysses knew how to make it somewhat bearable to bear,
He heaped up the leaves until he made a bed,
Enough to cover two or three men instead.

Just as a man, far from any neighbor,
Hides a hot brand to save himself labor,
Ulysses covered himself with leaves so green,
As sweet sleep by Minerva, goddess of wisdom was foreseen.

Alright, alright, gather around,
Let me tell you a story that's sure to astound,
It's got everything you could ever ask for,
And it's straight from the viral folklore.

Once upon a time in the land of the net,
Lived a person we'll call "Internet-Pet",
They were famous online, their reach was vast,
Everyone knew them, from first to last.

One day they posted a pic on Insta,
And let me tell ya, it was a real winfa,
The likes poured in, the comments did too,
People couldn't get enough, no matter what they do.

Soon enough, a brand reached out,
They wanted Internet-Pet to rep their clout,
They offered them cash, and free swag,
Internet-Pet was like, "Yo, that's rad!"

So they made a deal, and signed on the line,
Soon enough, they were on top, it was so divine,
Everyone wanted to know their secret,
But all they could say was, "It's just the net, don't you see it?"

And now they're living large, with fame and fortune,
Their name's known worldwide, not just in a portion,
So take it from me, and don't you forget,
The internet can make you famous, just like Internet-Pet.

BOOK VI

Y'all, Ulysses was tired and crashed in sleep,
Minerva bounced to Phaecia, real deep,
Phaecians came from a hood near the Cyclopes,
The big guys robbed them, they had no hopes.

Nausithous, their king, saved their lives,
He knew he had to make some drives.
Built temples, homes, and a strong wall,
He passed and Alcinous answered the call.

Alcinous had the heaven's wisdom,
To guide his island, he had the vision.
Minerva went to Alcinous' place,
To help Ulysses, link up the case.

Oh, snap! It was quite the sight,
Nausicaa, sleeping sweetly through the night.
Minerva changed her form, it's true, 
And appeared as Dymas' daughter, who
Was besties with Nausicaa, no less,
And looked like a sea captain, we must confess.

Approaching her bed, like a whisper in the air,
Minerva spoke to the girl without a care:
"Sup homie, it's your girl here,
Just dropping by to spread some cheer.
You and I, we're tight like glue,
So, listen up, I've got news for you."

Nausicaa stirred, and rubbed her eyes,
As Minerva continued with no surprise:
"Your laundry, girl, it needs a spin,
Your clothes are looking kinda grim.
Tomorrow go and wash them, my dear,
And don't forget to bring some beer."

Nausicaa woke up with a start,
Wondering who this girl was with the big heart.
She realized in shock that it was Minerva, the wise,
And listened with admiration in her eyes.
"Thanks girl, you're so chill and rad,
I'll take your advice, it's not that bad."

Hey Nausicaa, what's up with the clutter?
We need to get your dress game looking better 
With your wedding day approaching it's prime time 
Best believe you gotta be looking so fine 
You gotta shine bright like a diamond, sis 
Make your parents proud, it's your time to bliss 
So let's do laundry tomorrow, gotta make it neat 
I'll help so you'll be ready to swiflty beat 
Your potential suitors coming to court 
They're already seeing you as a great sport 
Let your dad know to bring that wagon 
Don't wanna be stuck walking 
We gotta wash those rugs and robes 
And get rid of all those nasty strobes

Oh dang, Minerva went to Olympus,
where it's lit and the gods are  anonymous.
No wind, no snow, just everlasting light,
They be chillin' up there, living right.

That's where the girl got her instructions,
Straight from Minerva, no misconstructions.
Now the goddess is kickin' back,
in the heavens, where it's always jackin'

The blessed gods are illuminated for days,
While mortals down here fall into a daze.
But we don't mind, we got memes to share,
And internet slang to keep us aware.

"Yo, Dad and Mom, check it - I had a dream that's so sick,
And I just had to come and share it, it's really quick!
I dreamt that I was doing laundry by the river,
But then some nudies came and made me shiver.

I didn't know what was going on,
Until I saw a hero in the dawn.
He was wrecked, but then he woke,
And I swear, it was like he was woke.

He asked for my help and I gave it,
And that's how my dream ended, legit!"

Her father said, "Sweetheart, that's insane!
We've gotta let the gods guide us, it's plain!
But when the council's done, we'll arrange
To take you and the maids to the riverside range.

We'll leave you there with laundry to do,
And make sure there's some food with you.
Just stay away from the men, okay?
They might be hot, but they'll get in the way."

Aye aye, sis, I feel your plight 
Dirty clothes can be quite a fright
But fret not, for I got you
We'll get that wagon, nice and new

Clean linen is what we all crave
Especially when we hit the rave
The council meetings need us sharp
We'll look so fly we'll set them apart

Married or not, clean is still best
I'll get that wagon, I won't rest
We'll do laundry like a pro
And then we'll dance, don't you know

We'll make those clothes so fresh and clean, 
You'll think they're straight out of a dream 
We'll have the best dressed family there 
And people will be like "woah, that's quite rare"

Oh my gosh, did you hear?
This girl's father is making her cheer!
He said she can have whatever she desires,
Including mules and a wagon to fulfil her entire attire.

No talk about her impending nuptials,
But we know that's what's got her in crucial.
Her father wants to make sure she's all set,
And he's got her covered, you can bet.

A strong wagon with a body, that's a start,
It won't be a hassle to cart all her shopping carts.
This girl's got it all figured out,
Thanks to her dad, no need to pout.

But what's the tea on her wedding day?
She's keeping it quiet, can't cuss or say.
All we know is that her dad's got her back,
And she's got her mules, ready to attack!

Yo, this queen's mom is slaying the game,
Can't believe this is all for laundry, what a shame.
The servants got a wagon and some mules,
And Nausicaa packed some snacks, no rules.
They even brought a goat skin full of wine,
These Greeks got it going, it's really looking fine.
She got on the wagon, with clothes and girls,
Hope they have a good time, and they enjoy their whirls.
Mules hooves clattered and they moved so fast,
Gotta hand it to them, their ride is built to last.

They went down to the water, looking lit and fly,
With pure water to clean clothes, no need to try.
Unharnessed the mules, let them graze on the side,
While they washed all the clothes, took dirt for a ride.

Got 'em clean, put them by the beach to dry,
And washed themselves, smellin' like olive oil high.
After lunch they started playin' ball,
With Nausicaa singing, chillin' overall.

Like Diana in the mountains, huntin' game,
Nymphs with her, all with a lil bit of fame.
Leto cheered her daughter, who stood taller than all,
Like Nausicaa with her handmaids, fly and all.

Oh dang, Minerva's got a plan so smart,
To introduce Ulysses to a girl with heart,
Tossing a ball, it goes astray,
And wakes up Ulysses to start his day.

The maids all scream, the noise they make,
Ulysses wonders what's the mistake,
He rises from his leafy bed,
And ponders what lies ahead.

A handsome girl, to guide the way,
To the city of Phaeacians, come what may,
Ulysses excited, he cannot wait,
To meet this girl, and seal his fate.

With Minerva on his side,
Nothing can stop this hero's ride,
All aboard the Ulysses train,
Ready to conquer, to glory attain. 

#NotThatSerious #MakingHistory #PhaeaciansFTW

Yo, my dude, where you at?
You're in a place that's lit, no cap!
Are they cruel? Are they kind?
Let's find out and unwind, in this state of mind!

I hear young women's voices,
Sounding like those of the goddesses.
Maybe you're in a fantasy land,
Or in a place where the vibes are grand.

Let's see if we can take a peek,
And explore what lies beneath.
Are they savage and wild,
Or hospitable with a smile?

Let's find out and break the ice,
And have an adventure, it'll be nice.
Maybe we'll meet some new friends,
And our story will never end!

Yo, Ulysses, my man, in a rough place
Naked, hungry, with fear on his face.
Looking like a lion on the prowl,
Seeking for prey in the wild and howl.
The young women fled, except for one
Alcinous' daughter, standing like a ton.
Minerva must've blessed her with courage divine,
To face Ulysses like a valiant feline.
Should he kneel at her feet or stay away,
And ask for clothes and the town's way?
He thought it best to plead from afar,
With words so sweet, like a shooting star.

Oh boy, you're quite the charmer,
I'm sure you think you're doing no harm here, 
But let me tell you something, 
As I speak into your ear. 

You're lost and stranded, we see, 
Twenty days lost at sea, 
You look at me in admiration, 
As I stand here with perfection nation. 

Are you suggesting I'm a goddess or divine?
That would be quite an accolade of a find!
Maybe a daughter of Zeus or Apollo, 
Your imagination must be on the overflow. 

But alas, my dear, I am just a mortal, 
Thriving on this earth with a strut that's immortal. 
My parents and siblings, yes they're a kind, 
But lucky are those who hold my heart in bind. 

Your comparison to a young palm tree excites,
Just like a sweet meme that ignites. 
I dare say, such flattery is rare, 
You find it hard to breathe and gasp for air. 

You've weathered the seas and pounding waves, 
Fighting with fate, as it leads and paves. 
But here you are, thrown upon our shore, 
While the heavens try to settle a score. 

I sense a great distress in you, 
As if the answer is far overdue, 
But here's my hand to lift you up, 
And boy, that should be enough.

Aw yeah, my queen, hear my plea
You're the only one I see
I'm new to these parts, don't you know?
Could ya help me out, let's go

Lead me to your town, show me the way
And if you brought a cloth today
Let me use it to wrap my clothes
So I'm not in tatters, heaven knows

I wish ya all the best, my dear
A happy home, a husband near
When man and wife are on one page
It throws off haters, brings joy to our crew, it's all the rage!

Yo, stranger, you seem chill and kind,
Luck’s a mystery, it's so hard to define,
Jove decides who gets success and who won’t,
So take what you’ve been given, let go of the taunts.

Now that you're here on this unknown land,
I promise you clothes, with a helping hand,
I'll take you to our town, it's not far away,
Our people are Phaeacians, that's all I gotta say.

Alcinous, that's my dad, he rules with all his might,
He’s our powerhouse, he’s our shining knight.
Come with me, you'll be alright,
And we'll make sure your stay is bright.

Yo, she called her crew and said
"Don't run away or act unfed
Can't you see this guy needs aid
Don't let fear make you afraid"

She knew he wasn't a robber or murderer
For they lived on a land jutting out fur
They were the Phaeacians, always sure
That they were safe, Jove's protection a pure lure

"This man is lost, he's in a tight fix
Let's be kind and offer some drinks and a mix"
Strangers and foreigners are under Jove's care
So give him food and water to repair

Wash him in a stream, find a spot that's choosey
And remember girls, hospitality is groovy!"

The maids ran away, like they just spotted a beyblade
Calling back and forth, like one big brigade
They made Ulysses sit down, where it was safe
Gave him a shirt and cloak, with haste
A golden cruse of oil, they did bestow
Telling him to wash, in the stream's flow
Ulysses spoke up, wanting to be polite
"Please stand to the side, out of sight"
"I need to wash off this brine so old,
And coat myself in sweet, sweet gold"
"I can't wash with y'all here,
Sorry to say, let's make that clear"
"I'm embarrassed to strip down,
In front of all you good-looking gals in town"

Ulysses was an OG who just made it through,
Taking a dip in the stream, getting rid of that salt too.
He scrubbed his back and broad shoulders with care,
And got himself clean, looking fresh and rare.

After that, he put on some new threads,
Supplied by the girl, with oils for his head.
Then Minerva stepped in, made him taller and stronger,
Like a hyacinth blossom, his hair even longer.

With skills like a workman who studied all art,
Ulysses was glowing, a masterpiece from the heart.
He sat on the beach looking quite refined,
Trapping the girl's attention, she was blind.

Mesmerized by his young and handsome face,
The girl whispered to her aides with grace.

Wait, peeps, lemme speak my mind,
This dude we're seeing, he's one of a kind,
The gods must've sent him, I say,
'Cause his looks are heavenly in every way.

At first, I thought he was meh,
But now I can't get enough of his swag!
I wish my future bae is as fly as he,
And sticks around like our bro, Odysseus, you see?

But first, let's offer him some grub,
And quench his thirst with a drink that's not a dud.
Then sit back and enjoy his divine demeanor,
Y'all, this guy's a real mood, if you know what I mean-ah.

Yo, Ulysses, don't be confused,
But we've got places to be, don't be refuse.
Hop on the wagon and let's go for a ride,
We'll get you home, no need to hide.

We packed you some food, so eat up quick,
And drink some water, you'll feel slick.
Nausicaa's driving, she's got the wheel,
We'll get you home, it's no big deal.

The journey ahead may be long,
But we'll use our time to sing a song.
Together we'll make it, we'll have some fun,
No worries, Ulysses, our mission's just begun. 

*insert meme*

Aye aye, said he, girl you've got it right,
I'll follow your lead, with all my might,
It's lit to meet the Phaecians, cool as ice,
I hope I won't mess up, and pay the price.

I'll walk behind with the maids and crew,
And maybe even catch some Pokemon too,
Fields and farm lands I'll follow with glee,
Hoping that they'll all be friends with me.

When we reach the town, it's time to flex,
Meet the cool kids and pay our respects,
A high wall around, to keep us all safe,
And we'll see ships, with strength and grace.

There's a temple for Neptune, by the way,
And a market for ship's gear every day,
No bows or arrows, no need to stress,
This sea-faring nation knows how to impress.

Oh wow, you're in a pickle, my friend,
This gossip might never seem to end,
Those Phaeacians got haters and teasers,
Dissing like internet trolls and teaser pleasers.

You're chillin' with Nausicaa, you're handsome and cool,
But the locals might judge you as just another fool,
They think you're just a sailor or a god,
And Nausicaa, as usual, is completely smitten and awed.

They might slander you fam, and spread the news,
And it'll be all over like last night's booze,
You're afraid of feeling some major shame,
Like when your tweets get blasted for all to claim.

It's clear as day that these worries are real,
It's like you spilled tea and now you gotta deal,
But don't sweat it bro, trust in your lady's heart,
She'll keep her cool and never let y'all drift apart.

Don't worry about the shade thrown at ya,
Nausicaa will handle what they say, oh la la,
Honestly, let them snapchat and take pics of you,
You're hot and fashionable, ain't nothing they can prove.

Yo, peaeps listen to me,
I'll help you out of this misery.
If you wanna go back home,
Don't go around like a roaming gnome.

I got the hookup, the perfect plan,
You'll reach your homeland like a boss, man.
See a beautiful grove of poplars,
By the roadside, just like scholars.

Wait there, chill for a while,
Till we finish our work with a smile.
My dad's house is one of a kind,
A child can show you, it's not hard to find.

Walk through the outer court,
Cross the inner court like a sport.
My mother's spinning purple wool,
Maids around her, a vibe so cool.

Don't worry about my dad, sitting like a god,
Just touch my mom's knees, give it a nod,
She'll do the magic to bring you home,
No matter what country, no more to roam. 

Now, that's the tea, you can trust me,
With this plan, soon you'll be free.

Okay, hear me out, this is quite the feat,
Ulysses and his maids were walking down the street,
The mules were on point, they were drawn to perfection,
Their hooves hitting the pavement in a rhythmic connection.

Our girl was the boss, cracking her whip with ease,
Making sure the pace was right, nothing to tease,
And as the sun set, they reached Minerva's grove,
Ulysses sat down, and prayed to her above.

He asked for her guidance, for her wisdom and might,
To protect and aid him through his perilous plight,
And with a smile on her face, Minerva appeared,
To answer his prayer, make his worries disappear.

Y'all, this is straight up divine intervention,
Like when Drake drops a new song, it gets my attention,
Ulysses is lucky to have Minerva on his team,
This powerful duo is a force to be seen.

Yo, yo, yo, Athena hear me out,  
I'm in a pickle, that's no doubt.  
Neptune tried to wreck me, not cool,  
Now I need friends, I'm no fool.  

Daughter of Jove, with an Aegis-bearing,  
Lend me your ears, my luck needs sharing.  
Please have mercy, and show some love,  
I need Phaecians to take me above.  

Unweariable, hear my plea,  
I need some bros to set me free.  
Friends that'll take me in with glee,  
And show me how good hospitality can be.  

So, Athena, don't be shy,  
Grant my wish, give me wings to fly.  
Take me where my heart can sigh,  
And make this odyssey one to amplify.  

#NoShadeButNeptuneIsAnnoying.

Oh dang, Ulysses prayed all night,
But Minerva warned, "It's not alright."
She heard his plea, but had to cloak,
Hiding from Neptune's angry stroke.

The sea god rages, he won't quit,
Trying to halt Ulysses' trip.
Minerva knows this fiery strife,
So she keeps hidden, out of sight.

But she'll help Ulysses in his plight,
Guide him towards his home so bright,
With memes and slang, she'll light the way,
And make sure he's okay, okay?

Yo, what's poppin' fam, let me tell you a story
It's gonna be lit, trust me, not at all boring
It's about this dude, who's a total mood
And the crazy things he did, oh my god, dude

He woke up one day and said "yeet"
I'm gonna go on an adventure, something sweet
So off he went, to the great unknown
With his squad, they were all in the zone

They traveled to places, seen only in memes
The sights were dope, and the vibes supreme
They even went to a galaxy far far away
And met Yoda, who had some wise words to say

But then, things got a little cray
They stumbled upon a dragon, who just wanted to play
They battled it out, with swords and some wit
And in the end, they won, no need to quit

The dude and his squad, they were queens and kings
They celebrated their victory, and did some sick things
They partied all night, like it was the end of the year
And the dude bellowed "YEET", without any fear

So, that's the story, my fam, hope you liked it
Now go out there, and live your life, and just be a lit kit.

BOOK VII

Yo, Ulysses was on his knees, praying to the gods with ease,
But Nausicaa drove on with the mules, make no mistake, no fees.
Arrived at her crib, her brothers were there,
Looking like gods, with good hair.

They took the mules out of the wagon with grace,
Packed all the clothes, it was quite the chase.
As for Nausicaa, she went to her room,
Where the fire was lit, and the vibes go vroom.

Eurymedusa was the servant's name,
She was brought from Apeira, not a claim to fame.
She was given to Alcinous as a prize,
But she took care of Nausicaa, no lies.

She brought supper to Nausicaa with care,
And that's what really happened, this is no dare.
So sit tight, and maybe you'll hear,
More stories full of culture, no fear!

"Aye, what's up, little Miss?
Got any tea in that pitcher, sis?
I'm just tryna make it to the town,
But I don't wanna get knocked down.

Minerva, is that you in disguise?
Hiding me from these Phaecian guys?
I appreciate the extra help,
I don't wanna be treated like a whelp.

These people seem a little too proud,
I wanna blend in with the crowd.
But if they ask who I am,
What's my story, what's my jam?

I'll just have to come up with a tale,
Maybe something that will prevail.
But for now, let's just keep walking,
And Minerva, thanks for the talking."

Oh snap, you're a stranger here,
But don't you fear, I'm oh so near.
King Alcinous's house? No biggie,
I'll guide you there like a true millennial prodigy.

You're in distress? That's not cool,
But don't worry, I won't give you a ridicule.
I got you, fam, don't you stress,
Together, we'll handle this crazy mess.

You're a foreigner, that's all good,
I'll show you the way, like I should.
This town and country may seem strange,
But with me as your guide, things will change.

So let's get lit and start the journey,
To King Alcinous's house, it won't be blurry.
Don't forget to snap some pics along the way,
For your Insta story, have a great day!

Aye aye, Minerva, you're the queen of the town
I'll follow you like a lost puppy hound
But shush your lips and don't say a thing
Not a word, not a peep, no questions to bring

These seafaring people don't like strangers so bold
They might leave us in the dust, out in the cold
They sail the seas like it's no biggie
With ships so sleek, faster than a Wiggy

We'll make it to Alcinous's house with ease
Just trust in me, I'll make sure we please
So hold your horses, we'll stick to the plan
And glide through this town like we're on Instagram

Oh my goodness, Ulysses, can you even believe
The beauty of this city, it's like a dream, you'll achieve
Their harbors, their ships, oh it's all so grand
And don't get me started on the walls and castle stands

But wait, hold up, don't let them see your face
Minerva's got your back, she's put you in a secret hiding place
They won't even know you're here, it's all good
Just follow my lead, do what I say, as you should

And now, behold, the palace of the king
A sight so magnificent, it'll make your heart sing
Minerva, with her wisdom, to Ulysses spoke
Get ready, my dude, for what's about to go down, it's no joke

Yo dad, check out this pad,
Where some VIPs make people glad.
Don't be scared, just go straight up,
Boldness wins, don't interrupt.
The queen's the one you need to find,
Arete's her name, they're intertwined.
Descended from Neptune, oh so great,
Nausithous and Periboea, first rate.
Even the mom was drop-dead fine,
Euroymedon's youngest, divine.
Giants, he ruled with all his might,
But his fate got twisted, not so bright.

Yo, listen up, this tale's insane
Of Neptune's actions, we feel the pain
He slept with his daughter, and the result was
A great son, Nausithous, who made no fuss

Nausithous had two sons, Rhexenor and Alcinous
Apollo struck one dead, leaving Arete for us
Alcinous married her, and to this day
She's honored like no other woman, y'all, okay?

Arete keeps house like a true queen
She's the baddest chick that we've ever seen
With Neptune as her grandpa, and Apollo in tow
Her family history is quite the show!

Dang, this lady Penelope
Is respected, I gotta say
Her children love her, don't play
Alcinous and the whole town
Think she's a goddess, won't bring her down

Good woman in her heart and head
Her friends and their hubs, she'll help instead
Win her over, and you'll be blessed
Friends and home, you'll return, no stress

Penelope's the queen of goal-setting
Helping with disputes, never forgetting
With her by your side, you'll fly high
Just like that famous bird, blue guy

Oh, listen up, y'all, and hear me clear
A tale of goddesses and kings so dear
Minerva took off, left Scheria behind
And landed in Athens, who treats all like a kind!

Ulysses, meanwhile, took a different path
He arrived at Alcinous' palace, a place so bathed in wealth
In awe, he paused, staring at the bronze entrance
Golden doors, silver pillar, his wonder knew no hindrance

The walls' bronze gleamed like the sun at noon
Blue enamel cornice painted like the stars, he swooned
Every single inch, lavish and rich
The floor was bronze, the lintel silver, gold hook to bewitch!

A sight to behold, a palace so bright
A story so grand with no hint of slight
Both Minerva and Ulysses' path, so different and bold
Yet their journey led them to splendour untold!

Yo, let me tell you 'bout this place,
It's got style, beauty, and grace;
King Alcinous' palace is where it's at,
And those watchdogs of gold and silver are phat.

Seats line the walls, fancily designed,
With coverings that'll surely blow your mind.
The Phaecians dine in luxury and delight
With torches shining all through the night.

These fifty maids are always on the go,
Some grinding grain, some weaving, you know.
Their skills with thread is simply insane,
And they work so hard, it's like a hurricane.

They sail the seas like it's nothing at all,
They know their stuff, never skip a call.
And when it comes to weaving, they're queens,
Thanks to Minerva's teachings, they reach their dreams. 

This place ain't just any palace, it's true,
With all these boss females, what else is new?
So if you're ever in Phaeacia town,
Come and see the badassness go down.

Yo, check it out, outside the gate, 
There’s a garden for us to celebrate, 
Trees, fruits, and flowers you wouldn't believe, 
Pears, poms, and apples that make you feel at ease.

Figs so luscious, olives so divine, 
All year round, they never decline, 
Winter or summer, they stay at their peak, 
So juicy and fresh, you won't find them bleak.

Pear on pear, apple on apple, as you’d expect, 
Fig on fig, and grapes with no reject,
An excellent vineyard, like straight from heaven, 
The perfection of grapes is simply the best sensation!

Two streams go through, with water so cool, 
One turns into ducts, another remains a rule,
The town's people come to draw their water with glee,
From the underground stream that flawlessly decree.

Flowers blooming all year round, 
Ornamented in the most magnificent background,
The gods endowed this place with lots of swank,
King Alcinous is truly in the upper ranks!

Ulysses, my dude, was cruising through the night
Obstructed by darkness, he had no sight
But when he arrived at the Phaeacian house
He saw their leaders worshipping and getting soused

He walked through the court, still concealed
Then saw Arete's knees, and made his appeal
As he grabbed them, the darkness disappeared
And everyone was shocked, thinking Ulysses reappeared!

They didn't know who he was or what he wanted
But Ulysses spoke up, and everything haunted
He asked for their aid, for a way to go home
And the Phaeacians agreed, they wouldn't let him roam.

Yo, humble vibes, respect to the queen,
I hope your reign remains pristine,
But alas, I'm in distress,
Lost and alone, I confess.

Oh daughter of Rhexenor, what say you?
Can you and your man give me a clue,
A way home to my people and kin,
Where happiness and love reside within?

May heaven bless you and your guests,
The ones with the most, and the ones with less,
May they prosper with long life,
And leave behind no strife.

But now, Queen Arete, hear my plea,
A stranded man looking for a key,
To unlock the door to my homeland,
Where my family and friends make their stand.

Help me out, I pray to thee,
And all the gods above, set me free,
For I've been lost and far away,
But with your help, that'll all sway.

Yo, yo, yo, this is one cool story,
Echeneus, the Phaeacians' elder, all wise and hoary,
Sat down on the hearth, among the ashes,
And they all stayed still, like in some sort of trances.

But then he spoke out, honest and clear,
With wisdom that everyone wanted to hear,
For Echeneus was a hero, and he knew how to impress,
With his excellent speaking skills, he was sure to address.

And even though it may seem a bit bizarre,
I gotta say, "Okay, Boomer," from afar,
For Echeneus' speech may have been great,
But for Gen-Z folks, it's time to update.

Yo, Alcinous, what's your dealio?
Don't you know it ain't cool to have a guest in limbo?
You gotta make him feel at home, like he's primo,
Put some respect on his name, make him a VIP, yo!

Tell him to get up from those ashes,
To sit on a silver stool and make some bashes,
Throw him some wine and water like it's nobody's business,
And let him eat some dinner, not no mediocre dishes.

Jove the lord of thunder is the one to appease,
He takes good care of those who aren't sleaze,
And if you want to keep your status as fleek as can be,
You gotta show this stranger some hospitality.

So don't be a hater, don't be a fool,
Treat your guests right, and don't be uncool,
Alcinous, my man, you gotta represent,
And show this dude some love, 'cause that's what's heaven sent.

When Alcinous heard from Ulysses the tale,
He grabbed his hand without any fail,
And told him to sit by his favorite son,
Laodamas, who was having fun.

A maid then brought him water, so pure,
And Ulysses washed his hands for sure,
Sitting at a clean table with bread and things,
And eating and drinking like ancient kings.

Then Alcinous asked the servant to mix,
A cup of wine for a drink-offer fix,
To the lord of thunder, Jove so mighty,
Protector of suppliants, powerful and flighty.

Yo, listen up fam, let's give it up,
for my boy Pontonous, filling up our cup.
He mixed our wine with water with a flick of the wrist,
then gave it round, ensuring none were missed.

After we drank up and made our libation,
Alcinous spoke with such elation:
"My dudes, we've had a great feast,
now let's hear some stories, and we'll be pleased." 

He leaned back in his chair, looking fly,
expecting tales to make our minds high.
So come on, guys, share your amazing tale,
let's hear your epic journey without fail.

Yo! Phaeacian homies, hear me real quick
You've had your dinner, now go catch some Z's real slick
Tomorrow, I'm throwing a big bash, even bigger than this
For our guest, to honor him and celebrate him in absolute bliss

We gon' talk escort and plan his way back home with care
No inconvenience or harm, our guest shall bear
But once he's back in his crib, it's up to fate
He'll go through the motions, just like the rest of us, mate

Perhaps, he's a god in disguise, in human skin and bones
But that ain't common, for the divine beings on their thrones
Usually, they're upfront when we're offering grand feasts
They'd munch and party just like one of our own, with similar beats

But Phaeacians, we're not so different, we too can strive for greatness
Been next to the cyclopes and giants, and still keep our traditions up and ageless!

Yo, Alcinous, don't be absurd
I'm just like you guys, I haven't been cured
Of my problems, both bodily and mentally
You'd think my life's worse, you'd see

But still, let me gobble up this feast
For hunger's a beast that cannot be ceased
Even amidst grief and sorrow
My stomach's demanding food for tomorrow

But you guys, carry on with aiding me
To reach my home, that's where I wanna be
I'll be content with death, no reason to roam
Once I've glimpsed my possessions and kingdom

Let's eat and drink, focus on the here and now
Leave our woes, let's be present in the chow
And help me reach my desired destination
Despite life's trials and tribulations

Yo, Arete, lemme tell you, it's true,
This stranger's story seems wack but it'll make you go ooh!
He's from a land where the sun rises but doesn't set,
Travelled so far, I bet he's got the world in debt.

Those dope clothes he's wearing are not a lie,
Your maids and you made them, ain't that fly?
But who he really is still a mystery,
So listen up, and I'll spill the tea.

He's been through it all, this we know for sure,
Fighting sea monsters and gods, it makes one's heart pure.
But he's man enough to endure the pain,
From his trials and tribulations he has so much to gain.

So, Arete and Alcinous, give him the best,
We gotta show him some hospitality, let him rest.
And who knows, maybe he'll help us out,
With his strength and cunning, there's no room for doubt.

Oh wow, Calypso's island is where I'm at,
Ulysses landed here after quite a bat.
Jove hit his ship hard, it couldn't cope,
Making it impossible to safely steer or hope.

Nine days he clung onto the keel in despair,
And then, on the tenth, Calypso found him there.
Once on the isle, she loved him so,
Wanted him to stay forever and never grow.

She thought immortality was the key,
But Ulysses wanted to leave and be free.
Girl, Calypso was so nice to him,
But he needed to move on for things to begin.

Now Ulysses wants to leave the place,
Keep on fighting the gods just in case.
Ain't no goddess gonna keep him down,
He's a wanderlust king who wears the crown!

Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout a dude named Odysseus, he went through hell.
He stayed on Calypso's island for seven whole years,
And trust me, he shed enough tears.

But finally, she let him go of her own free will,
Maybe cuz Jove told her to or she had her fill.
She gave him a raft stocked with bread and wine,
And some fresh clothes that he looked oh-so-fine.

He sailed for ten days, then caught sight of land,
But Neptune, he had other plans that were far from grand.
A huge storm came and tore up his raft,
And Odysseus had to swim to shore, his strength was sapped.

But thank goodness, he made it to your coast,
And from there, his journey he would boast.
So let's give it up for this ancient lad,
'Cuz his adventures were wild, they make us glad.

Yo, listen up let me tell you a tale,
Of a sailor who went through an epic fail,
He tried to land but there were rocks by the bay,
And the waves threw him back into the sea, no way!

But this sailor was a fighter, he didn't give up,
He swam on and on until he found a river to plug,
A perfect landing spot, no rocks in sight,
He got out of the water with all his might.

He was tired and hurt, but he found some leaves,
And made himself a bed, oh what a relief!
He slept till the next day, all the way till noon,
When he woke up to a beautiful sight, he swooned!

The daughter of the king was there, looking fair,
Like a goddess on the beach with her maidens, aware
Of the sailor in need, they rushed to his aid,
They gave him food and drink, and clothes, unafraid.

Now, let me tell you, this girl was so kind,
More than we'd expect from someone her age, you'll find,
She helped him out, when he was in dire straits,
And he lived to tell the tale of their fate.

That's the story of the sailor so brave,
Who swam and slept and lived to see another day,
And the girl who helped him, a true queen,
Like a boss, like a legend, a true MVP, you feelin'?

Yo Alcinous, don't be furious,
I'm just glad that you're curious,
About why your daughter, ain't no scam,
Didn't bring me along from the tram.

But let me just say, with no bluff,
Your daughter's kindness was enough,
She showed me the way to your door,
And now I'm here, begging for more.

Your hospitality is really top notch,
And I appreciate it a lot,
But let me just tell you with no flack,
I'm here on a mission, that's a fact.

So let's sit down and have a chat,
About why you're the coolest cat,
And how we can change the world with your sway,
In a totally lit and dope way.

And in case you're wondering why I'm so fly,
It's because I'm living my best life,
And with that being said, let's get rolling,
On the most epic adventure that's worth telling.

Oh dang, don't throw shade at her,
Ulysses didn't follow, he was a lil' scared
He thought you'd be mad 'bout seeing him there
Everyone gets grumpy, it's not that rare. 
#justsaying #sorrynotsorry #suspish

Hold up, Alcinous, you're so chill,  
I'm feeling your vibes, I swear I will.  
Marry your daughter? That's quite the plot,  
But I've got a wife, man, forget me not.  

Your offer's lit, I can't deny,  
An estate and house? That's fly.  
But I can't stay, don't you know,  
I've got a long journey to go.  

Your sailors and ships do sound sick,  
Rhyming with Yellow-haired Rhadamanthus, a cool trick.  
And Euboea, furthest of all the lands,  
But I gotta decline, man, please understand.  

Thanks though, for your hospitality,  
You're one cool dude, that's our reality.  
I'll take my leave, on my own way,  
But I know we'll meet another day.

Oh snap, Ulysses kicked back and prayed it up
"Yo, Jove, make Alcinous stay true to his pup
If he does, he'll get fame that ain't never gonna stop,
And then I can finally bounce and return to my crop."

The maids were like "yo, let's set the bed"
With "good red rugs" to rest Ulysses' head
They spread coverlets and woollen cloaks too
For our boy Ulysses who was feeling blue

Then the maids grabbed torches, so bright and gleaming
Urging Ulysses to sleep, without any scheming
"Come with us, sir stranger, your bed is all set"
And our guy was excited, he couldn't forget

So he went to his bed, feeling really glad
The maids, they did good, no one was feeling bad
Here ends the story of Ulysses' rest
Now it's time to sleep, we wish you the best!

Check it, y'all, Ulysses in a bed,  
A room with echo, right above the gateway, it's said.  
But Alcinous, he's laid up in the inner lair,  
With the queen, his wife, beside him without a care.  

It's lit, Ulysses resting up in a cozy place,  
While the sounds beneath him add to the space.  
And Alcinous, he's chillin' in the main part,  
With his lady, feelin' fine in his heart.  

It's all good in this palace, that's for sure,  
Ulysses and Alcinous ain't messin' with the poor.  
But hey, props to them for living it up,  
While the rest of us deal with life and all its stuff.  

So let's raise a glass, and give a toast,  
To these two kings and their royal coast.  
They may live in luxury and dine on the freshest dish,  
But we all know that life is more than just this.

Hey there, let me tell you a tale,
A story that'll make you wail.
It's about a wicked party last night,
I swear, it was totally outta sight.

The vibes were lit, the music bumpin',
The energy in the air, truly something.
There were peeps from all over the place,
Swapping deets and showing their face.

The drinks were flowing, the people glowing,
And the DJ had the speakers loudly blowing.
I was vibin' and groovin' all over the floor,
I couldn't help but scream "Yass queen, encore!"

The party kept raging till the break of dawn,
And we didn't stop until our energy was gone.
My phone was full of snaps, oh geez,
And the memories will forever please.

I gotta say, it was epic and sick,
A party I'd never forget that was so quick.
I can't wait for the next one, oh yes,
When we'll do it again and put it to the test!

BOOK VIII

As the sun rose up with its golden light,
Ulysses and Alcinous sat in sight.
They sat on a bench made of polished stone,
While Minerva went around like one of Alcinous' own.

She went up to the folks, one by one,
Calling the council to have some fun.
"Listen up, y'all, this stranger's got a story,
Been to hell and back, it's gonna be gory."

"Phaeacians, come and hear him out,
He's a god among men, no doubt."
With her words, they all stepped up,
Excited to hear this stranger's stuff.

Memes he didn't have, but tales he had plenty,
Of the rough seas and battles aplenty.
So listen up folks, don't miss a beat,
He's got stories that are hard to beat.

Yo, listen up, let me tell you 'bout Ulysses
A man so lit, his skills never cease
The Phaecians were impressed, they couldn't believe
How tall and stately he appeared to be 

Minerva did her thing, the goddess of beauty
Gave Ulysses a glow, so everyone could see
They all wanted to come, they flocked to the hall
From seats to standing room, it was packed wall-to-wall 

Alcinous, the king, took the lead, started to speak
About the trials of skill, challenges they would seek
Ulysses was ready, he was gonna bring the heat
And show them all why he was elite. 

Meme references, internet slang, it's all good to go
When telling the tale of Ulysses, a hero we all know.

"Ok listen, y'all," he began with a grin,
"This stranger needs escort, let's let him in.
He came from East or West, we don't know,
But we can help him and let him go.
We'll get our ship, it hasn't sailed before,
With 52 young sailors to explore.
We'll make a feast when they're out at sea,
Party at my house, it's lit, trust me.
Young guys, listen up, y'all are the team,
Row your oars, and fulfill this dream.
As for y'all elders, you'll be with me,
Entertaining our guest, you'll see.
Demodocus will sing, it's about time,
His songs are fire, they're so on prime."

Aye, the crew set sail with vigor and might,
Fifty-two oarsmen ready to take flight.
They drew the ship to the waters so blue,
With twisted leather ties, their oars they drew.

They spread the sails, so white and so bright,
The wind caught them and took them in flight.
On shore they went to Alcinous’ abode,
Where the feast was to be served with a load.

The precincts filled with men, all in a row,
Old and young, not a one was slow.
Alcinous killed many beasts for the meal,
A feast so grand, it would make your heart feel.

Demodocus was fetched to the hall,
His tunes and songs would enliven all.
The banquet was lit, that much is true,
And the guests were all stoked for what would ensue.

Yo, check it out, a famous bard! 
Demodocus, songbird, ain't it hard? 
The muse loved him, gave him voice divine,
But snatched his sight, that's not so fine.

Pontonous led him to his seat,
Set him upright, gave him a treat.
Hung his lyre, showed him where to feel,
A basket of food, and wine to keel.

Now the bard can make us all swoon,
With his melodies, come hear them soon!
He may not see, but he sure can croon,
Thanks to the muse and her gift boon. 

*insert "he's blind but he can still play a mean guitar" meme*

As the feast began, everyone indulged to eat and drink,
But then Demodocus grabbed the mic and made us all start to think,
He sung the songs of the heroes and the clash between two greats,
Ulysses and Achilles, whose words were like a game of high stakes.

Agamemnon grinned ear to ear when the quarrel began,
For Apollo had warned him with a fortune-telling plan,
In the end, these fierce words were the foundation of a war so grim,
Between Danaans and Trojans, causing everything to become quite dim. 

It's like when two squad members start a battle of their own,
Over something petty, but neither one wants to be alone,
And that's when things get crazy and start to escalate,
Leading to a mess, just like the Trojan War's fate.

As the bard strummed his strummer,
Ulysses couldn't help but be a bummer,
He pulled his mantle over his face,
Didn't want the Phaeacians to see his disgrace.

After wiping the tears from his eyes,
Ulysses made a drink-offering to the skies,
But when the Phaeacians wanted to hear more,
Ulysses' sadness overflowed to the floor.

No one noticed, except for Alcinous,
Who heard Ulysses' blubbering with focus,
He said, "Let's move on to sports right away,
To show off our skills that we display."

The Phaeacians agreed to the proposition,
Excited to show off their athletic ambition,
Boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners too,
They wanted to impress their guest with full view.

Yo, check out these Phaeacians, they're not fake,
They're headed to some sports, make no mistake.
Demodocus's lyre is hangin' on its peg,
This event's gonna be lit, like a viral meme saga.

A crowd of thousands is following the crowd,
The prizes are poppin', the competitors are proud.
Acroneos, Ocyalus, and Prymneus are here,
Elatreus, Nauteus, Anchialus, they're all cheer.

Euryalus is the Mars-lookin' guy,
The girls will be screaming, they won't even try to be sly.
Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, too,
Step up to the plate, they're ready to woo.

The sons of Alcinous know how to ball,
They're ready to go, ready to give their all.
This competition is fierce, like a Twitter fight,
The winner will be crowned tonight.

Yo, let me tell you of this stranger, he's got power
His build is impressive, it's quite the shower
He's faced the sea and all its wrath
But can he beat our champions on this path?

First were the foot races, a sight to see
Clytoneus won by a length, he's speedy, you'll agree
Next up was wrestling, and Euryalus took the crown
Amphialus jumped the farthest, he earned that renown

Elatreus threw the disc like a pro
No one could match him, not even close, bro
Then there was boxing, Laodamas reigned supreme
But can this stranger, with his muscles, join our team?

Now, let's ask him, the man of the hour
Does he excel in anything? Give us the power!
He's suffered much, we can tell, but his strength remains
Let's see if he can handle our sporting domains.

Oh snap, Euryalus. No need to be a buzzkill,
Laodamas just wants to show some hospitality skill.
But if you think you got this, go ahead, give it a try,
Talk to your guest, maybe offer him some pie.

It's all good, Laodamas won't feel no type of way,
Just trying to make his guest feel welcome and okay.
But if you don't wanna help, that's cool too,
Just don't be surprised if your guest says adieu.

Yo Laodamas, you're right on time
Challenging Ulysses to an event that's prime
He's got skills, don't you see?
Hands and feet, proper man he'll be

Ulysses, show them what you got
Try anything, give it a shot
Skillful in many, he'll take them all
No need to worry, he'll stand tall

Don't let sorrow fill your mind
Let's leave all the bad stuff behind
The ship awaits and the crew is set
Your homecoming moments will be jet

Yo Laodamas, why you playin' with me this way? 
My head ain't in the game, I got bigger things to say.
I've been through the ringer, my troubles are sky high,
Now I'm here before you, begging you to comply.

I'm asking for your help, your king and your nation,
To aid me on my way back to my own station.
Home is where my heart is, I need to get there fast,
So please don't make this hard for me, just make it last.

I'm not here to compete, no need for contests or debate,
Just trying to get back to where I belong, before it's too late.
So if you see me struggling, don't add to my trials and strife,
Just lend me a helping hand and let me get on with my life.

Hold up, Euryalus, why you gotta be so mean?
Flexing your athletic skills is just plain obscene.
Not all of us are built for sports or physical might,
But that doesn't mean we can't win at life, am I right?

Maybe this dude's a captain or a merchant, that's fine,
They're hustling hard and making bank all the time.
Just because he's not ripped or jacked to the max,
Doesn't mean he can't handle business and stack up his racks.

Don't judge a book by its cover, that's so 2010,
Let's focus on the substance and not on our ends.
We're all unique and have different things we're good at,
So let's lift each other up instead of being a brat.

Plus, who knows what hidden talents this guy might have?
Maybe he's a trader by day and a ninja by night, that's rad.
So let's chill with the insults and give him some respect,
'Cause being a well-rounded person is what's really correct.

"Hey, hold up, dude," Ulysses said,
"You're acting like a real cornbread.
Not everyone's blessed with mad skill, 
Some just got looks, that's the deal.

But see, that's where you messed up, son,
Talkin' smack, thinkin' you won.
I got the talent, the strength, the might,
I used to win battles and sports fights.

Sure, I may be old and weary,
But I'll still show you, don't be leery.
You got me heated, it's not cool,
So let's compete, and I'll make you the fool."

Dang, he's a braniac, got skillz for days 
With a toss so tight, it cuts like a blade 
The Phaeacians stood no chance, just amazed 
As the disc went soaring, into the sun's rays 

Minerva, as a dude, went to see the prize 
Where the disc did land, far from mortal eyes 
"Bro, you're killing it!" she said, with surprise 
"There's no way anyone can beat your high rise." 

So he won the contest, without being vexed 
A true athlete, he proved to be the best 
The Phaeacians just shrugged, feeling perplexed 
"Yo, he's got the moves, he outdid the rest!"

Yo, Ulysses was on the savage grind
Challenging the young men, losing no time
He could throw the disc like it was light
And he wasn't afraid to put up a fight

But wait, he said, hold up, pause
Laodamas, he couldn't impose
He was the homie, don't want to compete
It ain't wise, especially when not on home street

But anyone else, come on and bring it
Ulysses was ready, didn't even flinch
He could box, wrestle, and even run
He was down for whatever, he was that fun

He was an archer, the best you ever saw
In battle, shooting from afar
No matter the number, he always won
He was the one, get it done

Hercules and Eurytus, they were legends at bow
So Ulysses backed down, he just couldn't go
And throwing a dart? He was the king
No one came close, no one could swing

He was honest though, his weakness was clear
Running was a tough one, too much fear
But no matter what, Ulysses didn't crack
He was always on point, no turning back. 

Lit, throwin' those discs like it's nothing
Ulysses was flexin', he wasn't bluffin'
And as for running, he wasn't the best
But that doesn't mean he couldn't ace the rest!

Yo, King Alcinous spittin' some facts,
Saying they're the masters in many an act.
Not great with their fists, nor wrestling, you see,
But they're speedy and seafaring, trust me.

They love lavish dinners and bust a move to the beat,
Wearing clean linen, getting warm baths, the heat.
Demodocus left his lyre, oh no,
But they gon' get it, and put on a show.

Dancers, bring your best moves, impress the guest,
Let him go home, and tell everyone the rest.
How they're the greatest in all the land,
Running, dancing, singing, a talented band.

As the servant hustled off, the stewards took the stage
To make the ground bounce like it was the main rage
They smoothed the surface fast, so nothing was left to chance
And marked out a wide area, worthy of the dance!
The servant then returned bearing Demodocus's lyre
And the dancers took over with moves that were on fire
Their feet were lithe and nimble, moving to the beat
And Ulysses was super impressed, tapping his feet.


OK, OK, gather round, let me tell you a story,
'Bout Mars and Venus - you know, they got kinda gory.
Their love was forbidden, but they couldn't stop.
And with Vulcan away, they just had to swap.

Mars gave Venus gifts, made her feel oh-so-fine,
Even though their actions were such a crime.
They did it in Vulcan's bed, that was really low.
And the sun saw it all, said "Yo, bro!"

Vulcan was pissed, he had to take action.
So he went to his forge, with some serious traction.
He made some chains, that were super strong,
So that they couldn't escape, no matter how long.

He put them all over the bed, with such great care,
And when it was done, it was like a spider's lair.
No one could even see them, they were so fine,
But they were strong enough to hold, every time.

And then, just like that, Vulcan was gone,
Mars and Venus, thought the coast was clear, oh so wrong.
Mars went to her house, burning with passion,
Not knowing he was walking into his own last season.

But listen up, y'all, this story's not done,
Will Mars and Venus escape, or be ultimately undone?
Stay tuned, my friends, there's more to come,
This is just the beginning of a tale, that's hot like the sun.

Yo Venus and Mars, such a power couple,
Mars wants to go to Vulcan's house on the double.
But Vulcan's out, he's gone far away,
To Lemnos he travels, with no time for delay.

Their hands locked tight with love so strong,
Off they go, life's not too long.
But wait, what's that? There's trouble brewing,
This story's getting juicy, it's worth pursuing.

Listen up, fam, this ain't no joke,
These two are caught in Vulcan's poke,
He made a trap, so sly and neat,
And now they're trapped upon the seat.

Vulcan was mad, he'd figured out,
What Aphrodite and Ares were about,
His fury raged, he made a fuss,
Calling out to all the gods like it's a must. 

But Aphrodite, she ain't no fool,
All that noise was just too uncool,
She said to Ares with a sassy grin,
"We gotta bounce outta this trap we're in."

With a wink and a nod, they made their move,
Slipping out, they had nothing to prove,
Vulcan was left in his own dismay,
Another day, another trap, it's all just play. 

So now you know, the story of these three,
Caught in a trap that wasn't meant to be,
But when it comes to love and war,
Anything can happen, that's for sure.

"Yo, Father Jove, you gotta hear this, it's wild,
A sight that's ridiculous and makes me feel so riled.
See Venus here, she's causing such drama
Always dishonoring me for my physical schema. 

She's head over heels for Mars, he's a sight to see
Compared to me, he's clean-built and he's worry-free.
I may be a cripple, but I can't help this condition
My parents are to blame, it wasn't my decision.

Come and check out this pair for yourself
Sleeping on my bed like it's a bookstore shelf.
It gets me angry, it gets me so damn mad
To see them so happy, it's really quite sad.

But I don't think they'll stay there for too long 
Mars and Venus, they ain't that strong.
And they won't be sleeping much, that's for sure
They'll be up soon, that much I know for sure.

But let them stay there till her father pays his dues,
For his baggage of a daughter, who's only fair, but not tru(e)s."

"Hold up, this tea is getting hotter!" 
Each god was amazed, they couldn't believe,
That Vulcan could pull off such a trick up his sleeve.
Mercury exclaimed, "That was lucky, bro!"
While Neptune joked, "Vulcan's flames sure do glow!"
King Apollo just shook his head and sighed,
"Vulcan always impresses, I can't deny."
As they laughed and cheered, the goddesses missed out,
But no worries, they'll learn what life's all about.

Yo, let me break it down for ya,
Ill deeds never gonna prosper   
Limping Vulcan made it clearer
Weak ones can put down the stronger

Vulcan caught Mars like a boss
Hobbled in and took him down
Mars, the fleetest god with a loss
Looks like he'll get sued in town

Lame as Vulcan may appear
He still managed to catch the God of War
Now Mars will face some hefty fear
Thanks to Vulcan's clever chore

So remember this lesson true
Strength ain't always the winning key
A little trickery can get you through
Just like Vulcan's victory

Oh snap, Apollo coming in hot
With some scandalous talk that we’ve got
Messenger Mercury, oh he’s sly
Giver of good things, but this convo's why?

If chains were strong, he asks with a grin
Would Mercury mind sleeping with Venus, his sin?
Apollo, your words are wild and surreal
This drama got me like, “oh, I can’t deal!”

But seriously, let’s break it down
Apollo’s comments are shaking this town
Chains or no chains, what’s the deal with Venus?
Is there more to this story? Don’t leave us.

As your assistant, I’ll bring the hype
Mercury, Apollo, and Venus, what a tripe
Let’s get to the bottom of this scandalous plot
This juicy drama is hitting the spot!

Yo, Mercury's got bars, just like he's got wings,
He's trying to get with someone who's royalty, who sings.
He's talking 'bout Queen Olympe, a goddess so fine,
He'd break any chains just to make her his Valentine.

Mercury's got game, he's smooth like no other,
He'd slide in her DMs, and he wouldn't bother.
He knows he can't be with her, yet he daydreams,
A god with the hots for a goddess, it seems.

But wait, did I hear him say "if I could"?
Does that mean he can't get what he would?
Apollo's the king, he's got all eyes on him,
Mercury's just trying, but the odds are slim.

So let's sit back, and watch this play out,
Mercury's trying to score, no doubt.
Maybe one day, he'll have his chance,
To be with the queen, and do a little dance.

Oh dang, Neptune's in a tough spot,          
Trying to get Vulcan to let Mars rot         
But Vulcan's not having it, he wants some cash         
Damage fees for the gods, Neptune's gotta dash         
It's a sticky situation, like spilled tea on my shirt         
But I hope they work it out, and Mars doesn't get hurt         
Maybe they can settle it with a quick game of Fortnite         
Or go viral on TikTok, now that would be tight!

Vulcan spoke up with a snap, 
"A bad man's bond is complete crap! 
What security would I receive, 
If Mars decides to deceive 
And run away with chains and debts, 
Leaving me to deal with all his regrets?" 

I mean, seriously, what can I do? 
It's not like I have a clue 
To force him to pay up his dues, 
Mars really must choose 
To stay and face the music, 
Or else the consequences will be quite tragic. 

This is like when someone owes you cash, 
But they decide to make a mad dash 
And disappear into thin air, 
Leaving you to just sit and stare 
At the empty wallet in your hand, 
While they dance off to some faraway land.

Yo, Neptune said with a snap, 
If Mars dips out, I'll cover the gap. 
Vulcan nodded and said he agreed, 
He couldn't refuse, he has a friend in need. 

No need to worry, no need to fret, 
My wallet's got it, no need to get upset. 
Vulcan's all good, he's got a flex, 
He knows Neptune's got a high-tech and sleek Rolex. 

So chill out, relax, catch a break, 
No need to fuss, no need to shake. 
Cause when the gods come out to play, 
There's no need to worry or feel dismay.

Yo, did you hear what just went down?
Mars and Venus, they once wore a frown,
But then they got freed and without a sound,
They dashed off to lands that they found.

Mars went straight to Thrace,
And I bet he set himself a fast pace.
Venus, on the other hand,
Went to Paphos, a destination so grand.

In Cyprus, she was greeted by the Graces,
And they gave her anointing with the most expensive bases.
They put on her some fashion so fly,
It was like throwing fireworks in the sky.

She was dressed in ambrosia oil so pure,
The kind that only gods can procure.
Clothing so ethereal,
She shone like a real material.

That's what happens when gods get freed,
They go and do exactly what they need.
Now let's hope their freedom does not lead
To anything we should dread or misread.

Oh my days, did you hear the way he played?
Ulysses and the Phaeacians were amazed!
That bard's voice was smooth like butter,
His tune was lit! I can't even mutter.

They were charmed as they listened with glee,
Did you see them swaying so effortlessly?
The bard's words had them feeling alive,
His lyrics reaching deep down inside.

I bet they will remember this moment,
Like a meme that goes viral, it's potent.
They'll rave about that bard's sick flow,
To everyone they meet, they'll let it be known!

"Yo, that ball be flyin' high up in the sky!
Laodamas and Halius, they know how to fly!
Their dance moves lit, keepin' the ball in the air,
Got the crowd hyped, they just can't compare!

But hold up, y'all, let me throw down some advice,
I may be old but I'm still twice as nice,
Why don't you add a little spice to the game,
Some new moves that'll bring you fame?

I'll show you how to mix it up with some swag,
Make the crowd go wild, snag a victory tag,
So don't be afraid to take some risks,
And trust me, you'll be the ones who get the kicks!"

Oh snap, King Alcinous, you weren't lying,
Your people are the dancing kings, my oh my-ing!
Their moves were so lit, I was truly awed,
I couldn't believe my eyes, I was totally floored.

They were nimble like cats, they were smooth like jazz,
Their rhythm was on point, they were hotter than hash.
I couldn't help but wonder, where did they learn these skills?
I need to take some lessons, I need to up my thrills.

But seriously, your folks are the bomb dot com,
I'll never forget it, even when I'm gone.
Thanks for the show, it was straight up awesome,
I was feeling the vibes, I was in the zone-dom.

Yo, this king is straight up chill,
Offering gifts, like it's no big deal.
He's impressed by our boy's judgment,
And wants to show him love without end.

The aldermen and town councillors,
Are down to contribute to the visitors.
They'll each give a shirt and cloak so clean,
Plus some fine gold, fit for a king and queen.

Our visitor will dine with a light heart,
And be gifted with more than just a start.
But Euryalus made a mistake,
Being rude wasn't something they could take.

He'll need to make a formal apology,
And give a gift that's not that cheap, you see.
This culture may be ancient and old,
But we can still learn from these stories told.

Oh my gosh, did you hear what he said?
Euryalus offered a gift, worth what we're told, 
A sword of bronze, shining bright like gold! 
The hilt of his gift, a silver treasure, 
And a scabbard made of ivory, nothing lesser. 

Can't you see the stranger's eyes, full of wonder,
Thinking to himself, "I must have blundered."
But Euryalus was kind, with generosity so bold,
He offered a sword and scabbard worth their weight in gold. 

Now, let me tell you something real quick,
Euryalus just made the stranger's day, no need to be slick.
The stranger sat amazed, feeling like a star,
Wondering if Euryalus came from near or far. 

But let's praise Euryalus, for his generous deeds,
He didn't hesitate, fulfillng the stranger's needs. 
So let's give it up for Euryalus, a true hero,
Who deserves a meme or two, oh let them flow!

Oh my gosh, this moment's lit,
A sword transfer? That's some legit sh*t.
Ulysses, take care and good luck to ya,
Hope the gods shine down and bless ya.
Away from home for so long, that's rough,
You've definitely had it tough.
May the winds blow away any mistakes made,
And a safe return home, the universe has prayed.

Ulysses said with swag, "Bruh you too, hope life's a vibe, no cap that's true. I won't front, your sword was dope, but don't stress, I'll still survive and cope."

Yo, check it, let me hype up this scene,
Like a boss, it's a whole lit dream,
Alcinous flexin', lookin' like a king,
With presents pourin' in, it's a whole new thing.

The servants bring the presents through the door,
Alcinous' sons receive them like a pro,
Mom's in charge, she's got it under control,
This family's righteous, they got heart and soul.

Alcinous leads the way, what a vibe,
The guests take their seats, they're feeling alive,
The house is bumpin', like a beat dropped low,
These homies chillin', it's a lit af show.

So let me wrap this up, with all my swag,
This crew is vibrant like a colorful rag,
They're family goals, a whole new level,
This story's fire, like a trending meme devil!

Oh my god, did you hear what he said?
He asked his wife to get the best chest instead,
Of course, it's not what you think,
A chest full of clothes that doesn't stink.

He asked for a clean cloak and shirt,
So his guest won't look like a dirt,
And heat the water so he can take a bath,
After all, cleanliness is the path.

He even asked for a golden goblet to sip,
That will make his guest remember the drip,
Of all the good times that they had,
From the present that the Phaeacians gave, not bad.

After his meal, there will be singing that follows,
Like a concert, there's no need to borrow,
It's his way of showing gratitude,
For the kindness he received, no attitude. 

So let us all learn from this story,
To be kind and show our glory,
To the guests that knock on our door,
A simple act can make them feel they're worth more!

"Yo, come over and take a seat,
I got some gifts for you to keep.
We got some hot water, so get in the tub,
And let it warm you up, cuz you need some love.

I packed up some gold and clothes so fly,
Don't worry 'bout a thing, just try 'em on, give it a try.
I even threw in a shirt from Alcinous, so soft and neat,
Together with a cloak that'll make you look elite.

So come on, don't be shy, take what you need,
And let me know if there's anything else you'd like to receive.
Sit back, relax, let the hot water do its thing,
And don't forget to thank the Phaeacians, the real MVPs of the scene."

Yo, check the lid yourself and lock it tight, 
Wrap the whole thing up, keep it out of sight.
Don't wanna get robbed, better stay alert,
Sleeping on your ship, you could get hurt.
Like Drake said, "I'm upset", if you lose it all,
So keep your eyes peeled and stand tall.

Oh dang, Ulysses was ready to chill
He locked up the chest, no one getting in for a thrill
Circe taught him how to seal it real tight
And he loved the warm bath after a long flight

No one to care for him since he left Calypso's pad
But her love was so strong he felt like a god
His servants washed and oil anointed
Got him fresh clothes, he wasn't disappointed

Then he bounced to the party, feeling pretty fly
Nausicaa saw him walk by, couldn't help but sigh
"Don't forget me, stranger, once you're home!
I saved ya once, so give me a shout on the phone!"

Yo Ulysses, let me hype up your story,
With internet slang and a reference to Cory!
Nausicaa, the daughter of Alcinous, so fine,
Saved you from danger, and that was really divine!

Oh mighty Jove, husband of Juno supreme,
Please let Ulysses reach his home and his dream.
For Nausicaa, his guardian angel he'll praise,
And bless her all his days in so many ways.

She saved him and was really quite cool,
A true goddess, like Lana Del Rey's pool.
So let's give a shout out to Nausicaa,
For saving Ulysses, hooray, hoorah!

As Ulysses spoke, he knew it was key, 
To show Demodocus love and respect like the G.O.A.T, 
For he knew, with his songs, the bard had a way to evoke, 
Emotions from the listeners, and make them feel woke.

The juicy pork was given to the musician in haste, 
A prize fit for a king, nothing goes to waste, 
Demodocus gladly ate the meal with joy, 
For his music had made the King's heart buoy. 

As the night went on, the bard played his lyre, 
Inspiring stories that set hearts on fire, 
Ulysses listened to the songs sung by Demodocus, 
So entranced, he did not care about the fuss.

With music that spoke of war, heroes, and passion, 
He felt a connection, a kinship, a worthy companion, 
The power of song is what makes us alive, 
For in Demodocus' hands, music thrived.

Yo Demodocus, you're the real deal,
Your storytelling skills are lit like a meal.
I bet you're tight with the goddess of the arts,
And bros with Apollo, who shoots arrows with his darts.

Your song about the Achaeans' strife,
And their journey back to their life,
Was fire, no cap, can't deny,
It brought tears to our eyes, don't lie.

But now, let's switch to a new verse,
About the Trojan horse, which was a curse,
Epeus and Minerva made it dope,
And Ulysses used it to give Troy a smoke.

If you tell it right, with swag and flair,
We'll let the world know, your rhymes are rare,
Your talent's so high, it reaches the sky,
Keep singing, and we'll never say bye.

Yo, gather round and hear this tale,
Of Trojans, Argives, and a horse so frail.
The Argives crept inside its walls,
Waiting for when Troy would fall.

The Trojans sat and went "hmm",
Should we destroy it or offer it to our gods as plum?
Their indecision was their fate,
For the Argives stormed out in a rage so great.

They pillaged the city without any care,
Ulysses and Menelaus were a deadly pair.
Deiphobus' home was where they struck,
And with Minerva's help, they had all the luck.

This story of war and cunning plans,
Proves that deceit can fall in the enemy's hands.
But let's be real, that Trojan horse,
Would have been nothing compared to Chuck Norris.

"Hey, Ulysses, don't you cry,
It's okay to feel emotions high.
Like a woman who mourns her man,
Weeping as much as she can;

But don't worry, we have your back,
No one here will give you flack.
Alcinous hears you loud and clear,
So don't hold back, my dear!

Now let's hear more of your tale,
Don't let your spirit grow stale.
We'll listen as long as you speak,
And your story, we'll never leak."

Ay, ay, Phaeacians, hear what I say
Demodocus's song ain't the way
Our guest is cryin' and feelin' blue
So let's all stop and think it through

We had a feast, ate till we were full
But our guest's heart is anything but cool
He's clearly in some kind of pain
So let's not make things harder again

These festivities are all for his sake 
So we gotta give and not just take 
We know it ain't easy being a stranger
So let's show some love and not be a danger

Treat our guest right, make him feel at home
We should always welcome those who roam
So stop the song, let's change up the tone
And make sure that our guest never feels alone.

"Yo dude, spill the tea and don't be coy, just tell me your name, country, and where you call home. My boys here got ships that own the sea, and they'll take you where you need to be. These ships don't need a rudder to steer, they know where to go, don't you fear. But hold up, my dad once predicted a wreck, with Neptune angry about our easy escort. He promised to bury our city under a mountain if we don't change our ways - scary AF, am I right, baybay?"

Yo, spill the tea and don't be shy,
Where'd you wander and which lands did you fly?
Tell us about the people and their towns,
Who was rude and who deserved crowns.
Share why you're sad about the Danaans' return,
Did you lose a kin that made your stomach churn?
Did you lose a G, a father-in-law, or your son,
A good friend that made your heart come undone?

Hey there, let me tell you a tale
About something that's sure to prevail
It's juicy, it's wild, it's hot off the press
And it'll have you saying "OMG, yes!"

So picture this, it's a total flex
A celeb couple, you know, one of the best
They were caught on camera, getting cozy in the park
And let me tell you, it's a whole new spark

The internet is buzzing with excitement
People are saying it's better than any enlightenment
And with the memes rolling in like crazy
This story is so good, it's even making me feel hazy

It's the talk of the town, on everyone's minds
The kind of thing that leaves us all behind
And as the story continues to unfold
I can guarantee, it won't get old

So keep your eyes peeled, and stay up to date
This story is sure to captivate
And let me warn you, it's not for the weak
This kind of gossip is something you seek.

BOOK IX

Yo, King Alcinous, your bard's voice is divine,
A whole crowd dancing and singing, it's so fine,
The table's loaded with meat and bread galore,
And the cupbearer serves wine, more and more.

But you wanna hear my story, my sorrows and pain,
Rekindling my memories, it's hard to contain,
The heavens struck me down, it's hard to express,
I don't know how to start, or how to progress.

It’s a tale of woe, of heartache, and despair,
It puts a strain on my soul that's hard to bear,
It’s a weight on my chest, causing me to cower,
I feel the wrath of the gods, it’s my darkest hour. 

But I'll tell my tale, through tears and through grief,
I'll rhyme and I'll meme, bring some relief,
And even though it hurts, and makes me frown,
I'll tell my story, through ups and downs.

Oh boy, let me hype up this story, so you won't be sorry!
First and foremost, let me introduce myself,
My name is Ulysses, the greatest of stealth!
Ithaca is my home, a place where forests bloom,
Neritum's high mountain, shining like the moon!
My island's surrounded by Same and Dulichium,
Plus the cool Zacynthus that we cannot do without!
It's true, Calypso and Circe wanted my heart too,
But nothing beats my country, I had to see it through!
My journey back home from Troy had dangers galore,
With Jove's will, adventures to keep; not ONE, but MORE!

Yo, listen up, story time's begun,
About a wild adventure that was quite fun.
Odysseus and his men set sail with ease,
To the city of the Cicons, without a sneeze.

They started sacking the town, pillaging their goods,
Living fast and free, like good fellas should.
But the men, they got drunk and lost their wits,
Drinking wine and killing sheep under the night's blitz.

The Cicons's armies, they came in thick,
With spears and chariots that made them quick.
Odysseus and his men fought with all their might,
But the gods weren't on their side that night.

These Cicons were too tough, stronger in the fight,
They had the upper hand with all their might.
So the men had to flee, with their tails between their legs,
Leaving their poor dead friends behind, under the night's yegs. 

Odysseus is a legend, but he'll sadly rue,
That day when his men didn't listen, and they fell through.
But it's all good, 'cause in the end he'll rise,
Into the sunset, with his men by his side, so wise.

Yo, so we sailed with sorrow in our hearts,
Thankful to have escaped death but torn apart,
Lost our comrades, each one a G,
We honored them with three invocations, you see?

Then Jove rose up and sent a North wind,
A hurricane that made us feel chagrined,
Land and sky were hidden in a thick veil,
Night came out of nowhere, our souls we did ail.

While our ships moved ahead with might,
The wind shredded our sails, oh what a sight,
Fearing shipwreck, we let them fall,
And rowed to land as our rescue call.

For two days and two nights, we stayed still,
Suffered toil and stress, no sign for thrill,
But come the third day, we raised our sails again,
Wind and steersmen took charge, oh amen!

I would've reached home, no harm done,
But the North wind and currents made sure it wasn't fun,
The Cape Malea was tough to double, you know,
Ended up near Cythera, high and low.

Yo, listen up, this tale's legit,
It starts with winds that wouldn't quit,
For nine long days we sailed the sea,
'Til on the tenth, land came to be.

The place was filled with flower food,
It tasted great, put us in the mood,
To stay with Lotus-eaters chill,
And never leave, just eat our fill.

But I knew better, had to act,
Before we lost the will to go back,
I dragged my crew, despite their tears,
And had them tie themselves to the piers.

Then I commanded them to row,
Don't let the Lotus-eaters' food glow,
Keep rowing 'til we reach our home,
Don't be lured by the flower's dome.

So they obeyed, and we set sail,
Avoiding the Lotus-eaters' tale,
And though we faced the ocean's roar,
We made it back to our own shore.

Yo, listen up, here's a story 
'Bout some Cyclopes, they're quite gory 
Living on grapes and barley 
They're a wild bunch, a bit gnarly 

They don't plant or plow the land 
Trustin' providence, they think it's grand 
No laws, no assemblies to go 
Just livin' in caves, don't you know? 

Each one's a master, a lord in his house 
No care for neighbours, they're as quiet as a mouse 
Wild grapes give 'em wine, what a feat 
But watch out for their ways, they'll be hard to beat 

So if you ever venture their way 
Be ready for trouble, come what may 
Cuz these Cyclopes are wild and bizarre 
Your own Odyssey, go risk, go far!

Yo, listen up, let me tell you a tale
'Bout an island so lit it'll make you exhale
It's filled with goats, not a human in sight
No plows, no ships, just wilderness and might

The Cyclopes live there, they've got no boats
No way to travel or stay afloat
They'd take the island, it's fertile and fresh
A perfect place to plant and thresh

Vines and grapes would grow like a dream
Level land for ploughing, nothing extreme
The grass is luscious, perfect for grazing
You could chill on the shore, completely amazing

No need for cables or anchors to use
Just beach your vessel, it won't be a ruse
There's even a spring and poplars close by
Water so clear, it'll make you sigh

So now you know about this awesome place
Wild goats, good land, and clear space
You won't find people, just the Cyclopes crew
But I promise you'll love it, just like they do! 
#IslandVibes #FertileGrounds #Wilderness

Oh my, this is one crazy tale,
We sailed the ocean without fail,
With no moon, stars or light,
We sailed into the darkness of the night.

A thick mist surrounded us all,
We couldn't see the island and it was quite the downfall,
We had no idea how close we were,
We couldn't see anything and it caused quite a stir.

Finally, we beached our ships with care,
Took down the sails and began to prepare,
We camped on the beach until the dawn,
Waiting to see what the new day would spawn.

This adventure was one for the books,
But we were lucky, we didn't overlook,
The importance of staying calm and acting quick,
Even when the night got real thick.

Yo, when the sun came up like rosy Don,
We hit the island and had some fun,
Nymphs brought goats to cook up with care,
And we split in groups, a hunting we dare!

We grabbed our bows and sharp spears,
And shot at goats, but no need to fear!
We got nine goats, and some got ten,
All day we ate, no worries back then!

We looked at the Cyclops' lair,
And saw the smoke in the air,
Almost heard them and their goat herd,
But we fell asleep without any word.

Next morning, it was time to convene,
So I gathered my crew and spoke with a keen,
What should we do, oh my sea friends?
That was the start of this wild adventure that never ends!

Yo, squad, stay put and chill, while I go on a thrill, 
My ship and I will go ahead and divvy up the hill,
I gotta see if they are kind or a bunch of savages,
Let's hope they're not uncivilized, nor remotely average. 
I'll explore their turf to determine their hospitality,
Are they humane or just a bunch of rats in reality?
Lemme do this on my own, I don't need a crew,
I will take on this journey anew.

Yo, listen up, this is no lie
We hit the sea and started to row, oh my!
We saw a cave with laurel trees
And a huge yard for goats and sheep with ease

It was the home of a monster, a sight to see
Who was away from home, maybe sipping tea
He looked nothing like a regular human face
But more like a crag, standing with grace

This creature's life was all abut the outlaw game
And he had a huge reputation for having no shame
So we waited for him to come back
Ready to attack in case of attack 

This place was wild, and nothing was sure 
But we had each other, our courage, and our love to endure 
So we waited and plotted, and hoped for the best 
With our hearts beating strong inside our chest. 

And that's when we saw him come back home 
Chilling out with his sheep, all alone 
Our adventure was about to begin 
As we prepared for the battle we were about to win. 

Like they say, "no risk, no reward" 
Our bravery was about to be explored.

Yo-ho-ho, I said "let's go",
Draw the ship ashore, and put on a show.
Our men stayed back, but the twelve best
Came along with me, no time to rest.

Maron, the priest, gave us a gift,
A goatskin of wine, a sweet, black lift.
We spared his life, and in return,
He gave us riches, what a burn!

Seven talents of gold, a silver bowl,
Sweet wine, unblended, my heart felt whole.
Nobody knew, but Maron and his wife,
How sweet it was, it could change your life.

I took a large skin, and filled it right,
With wine so sweet, it was love at first sight.
A wallet full of provisions, stand by,
Who knows what we'll face, we've got to stay spry.

We stepped in the cave, it was lit like the sun
But nobody's there, this isn't fun
We looked around, there's cheese galore
Lambs and kids, oh what a score
The dairy was full, with bowls and pails
But no one's here, no one prevails
My men wanted to steal, some cheese in a hack
But I had to meet the owner and talk the talk
He appeared, but dealing with him was no joke
It wasn't a good situation, my heart nearly broke

"We were chillin in his cave, feelin pretty brave
A sacrifice for his Cyclops taste buds we made
Munchin on cheeses, man they were great
Waitin for Cyclops, a dangerous date

He came in hot, with a load of wood to burn
We hid away, our stomachs churned
He brought in his sheep, all of them bleatin
Males outside, females awaitin milkin

He rolled a huge stone, no one could move
Protection from outsiders, his behoove
He milked his flock, then ate his meal
Half the milk for cheese, the rest for appeal

He spotted us there, we thought we were screwed
But we kept cool, didn't wanna be food
And then he said, with a deep growl rumble
Who the heck are you, interruptin my humble?"

Aye, aye, cap'n, you speak the truth,
But don't worry, we ain't no uncouth.
We're not rovers nor are we traders,
Just a crew with some #dope navigators.

We travel the world with the wind at our back,
With our #squad by our side, we never lack.
No hands against us, we're all about love,
Just some chill dudes, sent from above.

Our journey is long, filled with adventures untold,
But with our #lit crew, we'll never fold.
So don't worry about us, we come in peace,
Just some chill sailors, looking for a new lease.

Bro, we were shook by his monstrous look and yelling voice,
But I managed to blurt out, "Yo, we're Achaeans on our own choice!"
We were headed home from Troy, but thanks to bad weather and fate,
We got lost and now, my dude, we're in a crazy state.

We're the peeps of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, don't you know?
He's a legend all around the world, with a rep that steals the show.
With sacking such a huge city and killing loads of people,
He's got infinite renown, man, a legacy that's regal.

So, my dude, we're beggin' you for a bit of hospitality,
And maybe some presents, you know, for like a touch of civility.
But here's a warning, dude, from me to you, you'd better listen:
Jove protects us travellers, those who are desperate and missin'.

So, bro, show us some love and kindness, and we'll return the favor,
But if you don't, my dude, you'll have heaven's wrath to savor.
We're your supplicants, humbly asking for your aid,
And Jove is on our side, so don't you dare be afraid.

Yo bro, this Cyclops guy's speakin' real rude,

Talkin' smack and showin' no gratitude.

He's sayin' he don't fear no god,

Thinkin' he's tough, actin' like a fraud.

He's threatenin' to harm us all,

This giant's really big and tall.

He demands to know where we've docked,

Makin' his presence really felt and locked. 

But hold up dude, don't give in just yet,

Let's be slick and not get upset.

We'll keep our cool and think things through,

And hope that our ideas will come through too.

So let's not worry 'bout this giant's chat,

And pray to the gods, they'll have our back! 

(Insert meme: Cyclops blinking meme)

Oh dang, this dude's got some nerve
Trying to catch my homie in a curve
But my boy's too smart, he won't swerve
He'll give him a lie that he'll preserve

He said, "Neptune made our ship crash,
We were thrown onto rocks like trash."
And just like that, he made a quick dash
Out of that sticky situation, a clean pass

My dude is too quick to get caught
He's too smart, too sly, he can't be bought
His words are like gold, can't be taut
This guy just can't be stopped, what a thought

Oh my gosh, this story is insane,
I gotta hype it up or I'll go insane,
Odysseus and his crew were stuck in a bind,
Dealing with the Cyclops and his vicious grind.

The guy didn't even give a response,
He just picked up two dudes and dashed them in nonchalance,
It was like they were nothing but little puppies,
Blood and brains on the floor, what a sight so yucky.

Then the giant barbarian ripped them limb from limb,
Eating them up like they were sizzling hot Grimms,
Odysseus and his men were just lost and confused,
Crying and praying for a plan so they don't get used.

After dinner, the Cyclops took a little nap,
Lying in his bed surrounded by sheep in a snap,
Odysseus thought about killing him with his sword,
But then he realized they'd be trapped forevermore.

So they just sat there crying until the morning,
Hoping for a savior or some kind of warning,
This story's crazy, it's like a Greek tragedy,
With a monster that eats humans like it's some kind of delicacy.

Oh snap, when Dawn showed up with her rosy fingers,
Polyphemus, that Cyclops, was up to no good, lingers.
He lit his fire and milked his goats and ewes,
But then he snatched two men, and that's some fake news.

For breakfast, he decided to eat my guys,
Which was hella rude and not very wise.
Then he pushed the giant boulder with all his might,
And sent his sheep off, like it was just aight.

Now I'm stuck here, trying to concoct a plan,
To show this Cyclops guy who's the man.
I gotta have my revenge and make him pay,
Or it'll be just another wasted day.

Yo, here's the play, let me tell it in a new way.
This Cyclops dude had a huge club, I'm not playing, it was like a mast!
I told my boys, "grab that thing, let's make it bad-ass!"
We chopped off a piece, and sharpened it real nice,
Then hid it in some dung, which wasn't really a great spice.
We cast lots to choose who'd jab the Cyclops in the eye,
And the lucky four plus me became the squad to give it a try.
When the Cyclops returned, he got real crazy,
And drove all the sheep in, that's when things got hazy.
He milked his goats, let the young ones be,
But then he grabbed two guys, that wasn't cool, gee.
That's when I stepped up with my black wine in an ivy-wood bowl,
Ready to take down the Cyclops, now that's my goal.

"Yo, Cyclops, chill with the man meat,
Just try this drink, you won't be beat.
It's a drink-offering straight from my ship,
Take a sip, don't be hip.
Have compassion, don't be mean,
Show me the way, let's team up as a dream-team.
Your rage is cray-cray, you gotta calm down,
Otherwise, you won't be the talk of the town!"

Yo, this dude be thirsty and he's craving more,
He loves the flavor and he's ready to pour.
He's asking for my name, he wants to know who I am,
He wants to give me a gift, something lit like a hologram.

This wine tastes like nectar and ambrosia, oh boy,
It's like drinking from the gods, it brings so much joy.
Our soil grows grapes, but this drink's on another level,
It's got me feeling high, like I'm floating on a cloud like a rebel.

I'm about to take a sip and let it hit my soul,
It's so good that I can't control,
My taste buds are dancing, they're doing the yeet,
This wine is lit, it's got me feeling sweet.

So pass me another bowl, I'm ready to chug,
This drink is so good, it deserves a big hug.
And as I take a sip, I declare,
This wine is lit, it's beyond compare.

Yo, I gave him more wine,
Thinking, "This plan will be just fine."
Three times I filled up that bowl,
And he drank it up, like a drunk troll.

I saw that the wine had hit him hard,
I spoke persuasively with my guile card,
And said in a way that's so swell,
"My name is Noman, don't you smell?"

My folks and friends call me this way,
I hope you'll keep that in mind today.
Now give me what you promised, dear,
Or else you'll get a big ol' fear.

Oh my gosh, what a savage jerk!
He wants to eat up all the homies, like they're some kind of snack bar perk.
But he's got a plan, he's got it all figured out. 
Noman better watch out, or else he's gonna pout.

This dude is like the Grinch, stealing all the treats.
But instead of presents, he wants to munch on some meat.
He's a total villain, like Ursula or Jafar.
Noman's gotta run, he's gotta go far.

But hey, at least this clown's got jokes,
Thinking he's smart, thinking he's so woke.
But we know better, we know the truth,
Noman's gonna win, that's the proof.

As we battled the beast, he started to reel
Then fell on his face, what a raw deal
His neck hung back, he fell asleep
He was drunk on wine and flesh, so steep
We heated a beam, green and all
My men gained courage, ready to brawl
We thrust the beam into his eye, oh my
Turning it round, making him cry
Boiling blood bubbled over as we worked
His eye sputtered in the steam, so berserk
Like a blacksmith, we cooled it right
His eye hissed as we made our great flight
He threw the beam in a frenzy of pain
Yelling to other Cyclopes, what a strain!

Yo, Polyphemus, what's the sitch?
Why you making all that noise, acting like a witch?
Are your sheep getting stolen, bro?
Is someone trying to hurt you, or is it just a no-show? 

We can't sleep with all this commotion,
What's causing your emotions?
Don't let anyone be a fraud,
Or try to hurt you by force, that's just odd. 

Chill out, man, don't be so mad,
Let's keep things civil, no reason to be sad.
Just tell us what's going on,
And we'll help you all night long. 

Oh, and don't forget, it's not the end of the world,
Just like Harambe, we remember him unfurled.
But we gotta move on and stay strong,
Otherwise, we'll just get it all wrong.

Oh dang, Polyphemus in trouble, 
trying to sound off like a savage double. 
Talking bout Noman killing, 
But we all know his vision ain't thrilling. 

He's blind as a bat, 
probably thinking Noman is a rat. 
But TBH, he needs some glasses, 
or maybe some LASIK classes. 

He wants to seem tough, 
screaming all loud and gruff. 
But we all know he's just a clown, 
and Noman is about to take him down. 

So don't front and don't front, 
Polyphemus is just a stunt. 
He's about to get wrecked, 
Noman's skills gonna make him feel wrecked.

Yo hold up, let's talk about this
You're feeling ill? That's not bliss
It could be Jove, with his magical touch
But don't worry, just pray to your dad, it's not that much
Neptune's got your back, you can bet
He'll make sure you're not feeling upset
So take a break and rest for a while
Neptune's got this under his versatile style 
#GodlyAdvice #NeptuneKnowsBest #FeelingIllihad

Okay, so check it, after they left, I was straight chillin'
Thinking about how my plan had been so fulfilling
The Cyclops moaning, in so much pain
Feelin' around blindly, looking for his gain
He found the stone, movin' it with bare hands
Sat in the doorway, makin' his demands
Stretchin' his arms, trying to catch me sneakin' 
Thought I'd be dumb enough to do some sheep thievin'
I may be sly, but I ain't no fool
Maybe it's time to dip outta this school
But first, let me take a selfie with the sheep
Gotta let my followers know I've earned my keep

Yo, I'm hyped to tell you 'bout this guy
In a situation, real danger was nigh
He had to think, scheme, and plan
To save himself and his companions fam

This dude had to save his life, for real
The danger was huge, it made him feel
He came up with a plan that's slick
And let me tell you, it was quite sick

He had some male sheep, black and grown
He bound them together, all on their own
With withies, on which the beast used to snooze
He made them silent, without any clues

Each sheep trio had a man inside
They covered him up, keeping him out of sight
Three sheep to each man, safe and sound
Protected from the monster all around

As for himself, he chose the finest ram
He held on tight, like in a raft he swam
Under its belly, he made a cozy bed
Holding on its fleece, keeping his head

"Yo, little sheep, why you tryna leave?
You should stick around and chill with me.
I'll pet your fleece and give you treats,
You'll be the coolest sheep on these streets!

But wait, what's this? Something's not right,
There's something hiding from my sight.
Under your belly, oh what a trick,
These darn mortals are making me sick!"

So Polyphemus, in his rage,
Locked up the men inside his cave.
But they were smart and had a plan,
To escape and flee from the giant man.

With their wits and some wooden beams,
They blinded him and lived out their dreams.
And so they escaped the island of woes,
Thanks to their smarts and quick-thinking blows.

Yo, what's up, cool ram?
Why you actin' like a slam?
You're always the first to run,
Now you're just makin' me feel undone.

Is it 'cause you know your master's in pain,
And that Noman's crew is the one to blame?
You want revenge for what they did,
And make them pay for their misdeed.

If you could talk, you'd tell us where they hide,
And we'd make them suffer and feel our pride.
We'd squeeze their head and make them scream,
Until we're sure they'll never scheme.

So don't you worry, cool ram,
We'll get Noman and his clan.
We'll bring them down and make them pay,
And you'll be free to run and play.

Yo, Odysseus my man, you're quite the genius, 
Under a ram's belly, you got really serious. 
You freed your crew, and drove the sheep fast,
The Cyclops lurking, you made your escape last.

Your comrades wept, for those who had been slain,
But with nodding and frowning, you made them restrain.
The sheep were boarded, the crew on their seats,
And they stroke through the sea with swift fleet beats.

With a voice that echoed, you taunted the beast,
The Cyclops, he heard, he was full of unease.
Your cleverness proved, danger you could tame,
With style, grace and bravery - Odysseus, you got fame.

Yo, Cyclops, bro you messed up bad,
Eating others like it's just a fad,
You should've known what was coming,
Now the gods have got you running.

You ate them up, just like a snack,
In your cave, no turning back,
But your sin found you, that's for sure,
And now you're facing a mighty lure.

Jove and the gods, they punished you,
For doing something cruel and untrue,
You should have learned right from wrong,
And now you're singing a different song. 

So take this as a lesson learned,
Next time, think before you get turned,
And don't forget, what goes around comes back,
Now it's time to face the fact.

Yo, listen up, this tale I'll spin
Of a sailor who faced a Cyclops with a grin
He spewed his braggadocio without caution
But the monster was filled with rage and frustration

He grabbed a mountain and threw it with might
The sea shook in terror at the sight
The wave it caused propelled them back
Closer to land, on a dangerous track

The sailor grabbed his trusty pole
And guided them away from the rocky shoal
But he wanted to taunt the beast some more
His men were scared and begged him to ignore

The tale of this sailor is wild and insane
But his bravery and boldness remains
To face impossible odds with courage and pride
Is what Gen-Z and Millenials want to see and abide

Yo, hold up, chill for a sec,
Don't get this beast all riled and wrecked,
He's already thrown a rock and made us flee,
We're lucky to be alive, don't you agree?
If we keep talking, he might grab a boulder,
And crush our skulls, our brains he'll smolder,
Let's keep it hush, keep it on the low,
Or we'll be tweeting "RIP" like it's a sorrowful show.

Oh dang, it's getting lit up in here  
Ulysses, this dude's got no fear!  
Talking smack to a Cyclops so strong,  
It's like he's playing Fortnite all day long.  

"I put out your eye," Ulysses said with conviction,  
Making the Cyclops filled with affliction.  
But Ulysses wasn't phased at all,  
He's a hero, gotta stand tall.  

He told the Cyclops to drop his act,  
Or else his booty, he'll smack.  
With his squad by his side,  
He's ready to take on this one-eyed guy.  

Cyclops ain't got nothing on Ulysses,  
His rhymes are cold, while the Cyclops freezes.  
So next time someone asks him who,  
Remember, it was Ulysses that made him say "Boo!"

Dang, Polyphemus, that's a major bummer
Your prophecy's come true, then you're a goner
Telemus was right, he saw it coming
Ulysses may be small, but he's quite cunning

You thought it'd be a big, beefy guy to take you down
But it was Ulysses who made you frown
Now you wanna give him presents and be hospitable
And urge Neptune to make his journey feasible

Neptune's your dad? That's pretty rad
Maybe he'll help Ulysses and you won't be so sad
He's the only one who can cure your plight
So maybe it's time to make things right

Keep Calm and Welcome Ulysses in,
Polyphemus, the cyclops with a chin

Oh dang, this story's got some spice,
Talking epic battles, not so nice,
Our hero's laying down the diss,
Wishing his foe was sent to the abyss.

Neptune won't save you, that's for sure,
With that bad eye, you're just a blur,
Our protagonist don't hold back,
Telling his enemy they're about to face a smack.

Hades, oh Hades, god of the dead,
Some may say it's where you'll be led,
This story's got some serious heat,
Makes my heart skip a beat. 

But let's get real, let's not forget,
Memes and slang, they're a safe bet,
So let's keep it fresh, let's keep it lit,
This story's got me feeling legit.

Yo, this story got me quite alarmed,
Homer's Odyssey has got me charmed,
The hero with a never-ending quest,
Facing monsters and gods with no time to rest.

Poseidon drew his weapon out,
He wanted to drown Ulysses, no doubt,
But the hero prayed with fingers crossed,
And asked Great Neptune not to leave him lost.

Let him return to his home, his love,
But make it tough, like climbing above,
Give him trials, give him strife,
But let him return with a new life.

This story has us on the edge,
Like watching our boy's snapchat story dredge,
Will Ulysses make it home and find peace?
Or face further battles with no release?

Yo, this dude prayed up to Neptune,
Asked for some help, Neptune didn't swoon,
He picked up a rock that was real heavy,
Swung it real hard, it was surreal, man it was trippy!

The rock missed the ship by a hair,
But the rudder was super close to despair,
And the sea shook, just like a quake,
The waves went wild, it was no fake!

The waves pushed us closer to the shore,
We were headed for an adventure, that's for sure,
This story is getting so lit, so hype,
Like Drake said, we're going zero to a hundred, right?

Yo! We finally reached the island, no longer alone,
Our comrades full of sorrow, waiting by their phone.
We beached our ship and landed on the shore,
Divvied up the sheep, no one feeling sore.

The Cyclops' flock, all safe in our possession,
We split it even, no need for confession.
But one special ram, all said it should be mine,
So I sacrificed it, with a prayer that was divine.

Jove, the boss of gods, should have been pleased,
But his attention's elsewhere, his anger not eased.
He wants to take down both my ship and crew,
But with teamwork, resilience, we'll break through.

Alright, alright, gather 'round and hear my tale,
It's epic, trust me, like a viral viral hashtag on sale!
Our bellies were full on meat and drink,
Till the sun went down and night did blink.

We camped upon the scenic beach,
Chillaxin' under the sky like a peaceful leech.
The next morn' hit us like a dart,
Feelin' fresh, our crew was ready to start.

My men and I set sail like true warriors,
Rowin' in sync, cuttin' waves like popular YouTubers.
Our spirits lifted although our hearts were sore,
Lost comrades behind, leaving us somber to the core.

Oh snap, let me tell you a tale,
About something that's gonna make you wail.
It's crazy, like no cap,
And it all happened on the internet, just like that.

So I was scrolling through my feed,
Chilling like a boss, doing my deed.
And then I saw it, it was the tea,
A new meme that was lit AF, can't you see?

I clicked on it and it was fire,
Got me laughing so hard, I almost expired.
I had to share it with the crew,
And we all had a good laugh too.

But then, all of a sudden, what do I see?
Someone commenting, trying to come at me.
I had to clap back, no hesitation,
And put them back in their place, with no reservation.

It was savage, it was brutal,
But sometimes you gotta be mutual.
And that's how I learned a lesson, my friend,
The internet is wild, you better comprehend.

BOOK X

Yo, so we sailed on over to Aeoli Island,
Home of Aeolus, son of Hippotas, god-enlightened.
A wall surrounds the place, iron-bound and strong,
The air filled with cooking meat all day long.

Six daughters and six sons, all living happily,
Married together, but no need to get sappy.
They feast and chill, enjoying all kinds of stuff,
Sleeping at night, wrapped up tight, feeling plush.

The scent of meat is enough to make you groan,
But the island is legit - a vibe of it's own.
We were pumped to meet these hospitable folks,
Ready to party and have fun with jokes.

So check it out, y'all ready to hear
'Bout this dude Aeolus, the wind-man of the year?
He asked me 'bout Troy, the Argives and the Greeks,
And I told him everything without no sneaks.

When it was time for me to jet,
He didn't hesitate or make me sweat.
Instead, he helped me out with no complaint,
And made me a wind-sack, it was just too quaint.

This sack held the winds, each and every one,
For he was boss of them, his job was never done.
He put it on our ship, and sealed it up tight,
So that no breeze could cause us any fright.

He let the West wind go, with no delay,
But our own mistakes led us to go astray.
Don't mess with the wind-man, that's what I learned,
Or you might just end up, crashed and burned.

Yo, yo, yo, listen up, y'all, let me tell you a tale,
Of the Odyssey crew that sailed without fail.
They journeyed for nine long days and nine wild nights,
And woke to see their homeland in sight.
Odysseus was tired, in need of a nap,
He fell asleep and let go of the rudder, oh snap!
The men got to gossiping, and what did they think?
That Odysseus was hiding some treasure in his ink.
They praised his steez and how he made friends with all,
While they returned home, empty-handed and small.
But they wanted to prove that Odysseus was concealing,
Gold and silver in the bag they were stealing.
Let's see what he has, they all said with wide eyes,
Quick, before he wakes and it becomes their demise. 
#OdysseyFlow #SailorSlang #LitRhymes

Dang, that's bleak and sad,  
like waking up to find mom mad.  
Evil counsel ruled the talk,  
they loosed the sack like a ghost and stalk.  
The wind howled forth, a storm did brew,  
took us weeping, away from our own crew.  
Caught in the moment, unsure what to do,  
whether to jump or just make it through. 
But you rode that wave, took a stand,  
covered up and held your own, man.  
The men cried out as the wind did fling,  
back to Aeolian island, out of the sting.

Yo, listen up, here's a story,
'Bout a man who sailed in glory,
Ulysses was his name,
Sailing to Ithaca, his ultimate aim.

He and his men went on shore,
To replenish supplies and more,
Aeolus he sought to see,
For his help to sail wild and free.

A feast was in full swing,
Aeolus' family had everything,
Ulysses sat as a supplicant,
On the threshold, he was hesitant.

They asked in surprise,
'What brings you here, tell no lies,
Has some god been unkind,
And has made you lose your mind?'

They had helped him before,
And wished to do so even more,
But Ulysses had made a mistake,
And his punishment was hard to take.

Oh dang, this is sounding grim,
Our boy in trouble, prospects dim,
He's talking 'bout his crew, they slept,
And now for him, things ain't looking hep.

His friends gotta help, he's in despair,
Wants them to fix this mess, if they dare,
It's hard out here, but they got this,
No need to trip, no need to diss.

They've got the power to turn it 'round,
Take their bro from lost to found,
Let's hope they step up and make it right,
Before it's too late and day turns to night.

OMG, I told them my feels,
but the dad said "bye" no appeal,
Called me "vilest of mankind",
and sent me packin' I couldn't unwind.
I was abhorred of heaven,
Left with nothing but tears no leaven,
This situation was a total loss,
Father was colder than a Polar Boss.

Yo, listen up, there's a tale to be told
Of a crew and their journey, so bold
They sailed and rowed, for many a day
But no wind came to guide their way

Six days and nights, they did not rest
Rowing, working, giving it their best
Until they arrived, at the city so big
Of the Laestrygonians, who were quite trig

Their ways were strange, and quite unique
Where shepherds worked both day and week
With double wages, they could earn
By milking goats and tending to cattle, so stern

But beware, for danger lurks in this land
The Laestrygonians, mighty and grand
They're giants, tall and fierce as can be
And they'll turn any sailors, into their tea

So let us continue, our adventure grand
As we explore this land, oh so grand
With perils and obstacles, at every turn
The journey ahead, we have to learn. #SailorLife #GiantDanger #HerdingDreams

Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum,
We landed in the harbour, but it was totally dumb.
The cliffs towered high, and the entrance was narrow,
But my badass captains sailed through like there was no tomorrow.

We moored our ships close, for the wind was dead calm,
And I climbed up high to see if there was any harm.
But alas, no sign of life, only smoke rising from the ground,
So I sent two of my crew to check and look around.

Were they bandits or rebels, jolly or mean?
What sort of people lived on this curious scene?
We didn't know much, but our curiosity was lit,
And we were hoping for some memes or at least some good sh...rimp cocktails to eat.

Yo, the crew was on a mission, 
Walking down a road with precision, 
They saw a gal, lookin' like a snack, 
Fetching water with a bottle and a sack. 

They asked her who was in charge, 
Ruling this land so dang large, 
She guided them towards her dad's estate, 
But what they found was not so great. 

There lived a lady, big as a hill, 
My men were shook, standing frozen still, 
A Laestrygonian they discovered was he, 
Their hearts sank, filled with apathy.

I gotta say, Odysseus was one brave dude
But his story's wild, it's almost too much to include
He and his men stumbled upon the Laestrygonians' land
But they didn't know these ogres had a meal plan so grand

Antiphates called for the crew's demise
And his men had us saying our goodbyes
The Laestrygonians pelted with rocks with such power
Like it was all just one giant game of Tower

Odysseus, quick on his feet,
Cut his cables, and sounded the retreat
But they made it out, the only ones to survive,
Their stories to be passed down, as long as anyone can stay alive.

Yo, we sailed away
Dodged death that day
Lost some friends along the way
Arrived at Aeaean, my guy
Chilling where Circe, a goddess, resides
She's Aeetes' sis, no surprise
Both are sun's children, no lies
Docked our ship, silently
Guided by some god, undoubtedly
Stayed two nights, 'twas no brevity
On the third day, grabbed my gear
Set out to see what's near
Human encounters, or sounds to hear
Climbed a lookout so high
Saw smoke raise nearby
Thought to visit, or let it slide?
Return to my squad, I decide
Feed 'em well, and send a crew to abide.

Yo, listen up crew, gather around,
I've got a story that's sure to astound.
Lost and alone, wandering through the forest at day,
Feeling lonely and hungry on my lonesome way.
But then a god of pity came through,
Sending me a stag with antlers all brand new.
This fine creature trotted down to the river for a drink,
That's when I threw my spear and made him sink.
He lay there groaning, until he met his end,
And so I took him back, for my crew to tend.
I tied him up with rope, and carried him back,
Leaned on my spear, and followed the tracks.
When I got back to the ship, I called my men,
And cheered them up once again.
'We won't die yet, don't be glum,
We've got food now, yum yum!'
And so, we cooked that stag so fine,
Feasted on him, and drank some wine.

Yo, we was chillin' all day, eatin' and drinkin' our way,
But as the sun went down, we found a place to stay.
When Dawn appeared, I called for a team pow-wow,
"We lost, fam, no North or South, no clue where to go now."
But we can't stay stuck, gotta find a way,
We on an island, I scoped it, the sea was on display.
It's kinda low, yet there's smoke in the air,
So let's explore and see what we can uncover there. 
#LostAtSea #IslandVibes #NoDirection #CouncilTime 


As my little homies heard my voice so bright,
they were reminded of the Laestrygonian's fright,
And that ogre Polyphemus, who was full of might,
They cried tears of sorrow, oh what a plight!

But there was no use in shedding tears so wet,
So I split them into groups, without any fret,
Eurylochus got one and led his crew, no threat,
Whilst I took hold of the other, no need to fret!

Then we played a little game, off went the shot,
Using a helmet to pick the captain on the spot,
The lucky homie was Eurylochus, a winner to a dot!
He and his poor homies left and we kept the other lot. 

Both groups cried and wept, oh what a scene,
Fearing for the worst, a nightmare, a bad dream,
But we stayed strong, and avoided our fate, it seems,
Thanks to Eurylochus who led his team with esteem. 

#NotGonnaUseHashtags #CoolAssistant #RhymingGame #GenZVibes

Yo, they stumbled upon Circe's spot
Made of stone in a forest, that's hot
Wild lions and wolves were chillin' around
Under her spell, they weren't wild or bound

Instead of attacking, they wagged their tails
And rubbed their noses, without fail
My men were shook, they'd never seen
Such enchanted creatures, they were keen

To reach the goddess's house, they made their way
And heard Circe singing, like a fabulous fay
Creating a web so fine and bright
No one but a goddess could weave with might

Polites, the MVP of the crew
Said, "Let's call her and see who's who"
The singing goddess, woman or divine?
It's time to find out with a chill spine.

Yo, Odysseus and his crew,
Met Circe, wicked but true,
They entered her house, what a view,
Eurylochus was smart, he knew.

She mixed them food, cheesy and sweet,
But Circe played a poisonous feat,
She turned them into pigs, what a treat,
Odysseus cried "oh my, we are beat!"

The crew remembered their old days,
They were stuck in a piggy craze,
But Odysseus had some smart ways,
To bring them back, and end this phase.

With a little help from Hermes too,
Odysseus gave Circe a clue,
She turned them back, oh how new,
They thanked the gods, and bid adieu. 

#SorryNotSorry, Circe's ways were bad,
But it ended well, so we can be glad,
Odysseus and his crew were rad,
To escape Circe's tricks, they had.

Listen up, this story is wild,  
Our comrades were trapped, their fate defiled.  
Circe's spell had turned them all to swine,  
And they were left to wallow and whine.  

Eurylochus, our heartbroken mate,  
Returned to us in a sorry state.  
His words were lost, his tears did pour,  
We begged to know what happened before.  

He finally spoke of the pigs' sad plight,  
And how they were given acorns to bite.  
Our comrades lost in a swiney abyss,  
Their fates sealed with one Circean kiss.  

But fear not, we won't be disheartened,  
We'll find a way, leave Circe crestfallen.  
With strength and courage, we'll save our crew,  
And return home with an epic breakthrough.  

Yo, hear this epic tale that I shall spin 
About some guys who ventured in a forest within. 
They stumbled upon a sick pad made of stone
With a goddess inside who sang all alone.

The men yelled to her, called her by name
She opened the door, placed no one to blame.
The others went in thinking nothing was wrong
Except our brave protagonist who thought for too long.

He stayed behind, feeling wary and unsure
Maybe thinking the house a treasure that isn’t pure.
For ages he waited, but never did they appear
Though he heard no sounds of struggle or even fear.

What could have happened in that grand domicile?
Did they succumb to the goddess and her beguiling style?
Was it a trap or just fate that's quite grim?
All we know is that no one came out of there, not even a limb.

That sword of bronze be looking fine,
I slung it on my back, no lie.
I grabbed my bow, ready to go,
And told Eurylochus, let's hit the road.

But homie held me tight, so scared,
Saying, "Please don't go, we can't prepare.
You won't come back, let's stay alive,
Let's escape with the rest, let's survive."

I looked at him, shook my head,
"I gotta go or we'll end up dead.
I'll bring back the lost, just wait and see,
But if not, at least I'll die free."

Eurylochus looked at me with doubt,
But I had to go, there was no way out.
So I left him there, uncertain of our fate,
And ventured out, with courage, not hate.

Oh no, don't be a clown.
Let's get hyped and shake this town!
While you feast on your ship with foods so fine,
I gotta go cause it's my time to shine.

I won't sit here and let opportunities slip,
I'll work hard and make that money flip.
So, you vibing in your cozy home,
While I go out, hustle and roam.

Peace out now, see you later,
Gonna go chase my dreams, be my own creator.
You sit tight, eat and drink and chill,
While I go out, do the work and thrill.

Yo, listen up, my dude, it's time to hype your trip,
As you wander through the grove with that ship-wrecked grip,
Mercury peeks through, looking youthful and lit,
Like a teenage dream with his golden wand fit.

He tells you straight up, you're in a bad way,
Your men are trapped, Circe's turned them into swine, no way!
But fear not, my friend, there's no need to be shy,
Just take this herb, and give Circe a try.

It's a talisman, dude, trust me, it's true,
No mischief can touch you, no way to get screwed,
So head to the enchantress, with confidence high,
And see if you can free your boys from that sty.

Yo, listen up, I'll tell a dope tale
Of Circe and her wicked witchcraft fail
She'll mix a brew with drugs to make you trip
But fear not, with a herb, you'll give her the slip

When she waves her wand, you gotta be quick
Draw your sword and make her think she'll get a stab or a nick
It'll make her scared, she'll want to get laid
But don't reject her, you need your friends to be saved

She must swear and promise to not be a baddie
Or else she'll strip you naked, and you'll be sad-dy
So be smart, get her word and save the day
And don't forget, live, laugh, love, and slay!

Oh my gosh, hold up, wait a minute,
Let me hop on this story, let's begin it.
He pulled out a herb from the ground,
Black roots and white flowers, what did he have found?

The gods call it Moly, a plant so divine,
Mortal men can't touch it, that's just the line.
But the gods can do whatever they please,
Guess they've got the keys to all the treas.

This tale's got me hooked, can't you see?
What else happened, please tell me.
Did he use the herb for something grand?
Or was it just a plot, a mere strand?

I need to know, I won't rest,
Until I hear what happened next.
So come on now, let's not stall,
Tell me more, spill the tea on this appall.

Whoa, hold up, what's this I hear?
About a hero with a tale to share, let's cheer!
Odysseus is the man, with a heart full of care,
Walking on to Circe's house, with a burden tough to bear.

He calls out for Circe, and she opens up the door,
Invites him inside and asks him to explore.
Her house is fancy, decorated with silver,
A footstool for his feet, and a goblet to deliver.

But wait, hold on, did I hear that right?
She drugged his drink, with all her might?
She had a plan, for him to fall,
But Odysseus didn't feel the charm at all.

Circe then struck him with her wand,
Said "Off to the pigsty, go make your bond."
Odysseus had no choice, but to go with the flow,
And make his lair with pigs in tow. 

Like the meme says, ain't nobody got time for that,
Odysseus knew it, time to put on his thinking hat.
He'll come back strong, like a boss in control,
And show Circe who's the hero, and who's on patrol.

Hold up, hold up, hold up tight,
You telling me she gave you a little bite,
Said she put some herbs in your drink,
Thought you would pass out and your senses would sink?

But you came like a champ, didn't even blink,
She clung to your legs and began to think,
Who are you, where'd you come from, tell me the truth,
There's no way my drugs didn't leave you uncouth.

But you were spell-proof, like an OG,
With a resistance that was downright crazy,
So she thought, could you be the one and only,
Ulysses, who's always roaming?

You know what that means, time to be friends,
Let's hit the sheets and let the trust begin to blend.

Whoa, hold up, Odysseus, you dealing with Circe's fuss,
She's trying to turn you to mush, boy, you better hush.
No way you can trust her, telling you to hop in her bed,
She'll ruin your manhood, leave you feeling half-dead.

You gotta be straight up with her, gotta tell her the truth,
No need to beat around the bush, be your own sleuth.
She got your men looking like swine, that ain't no joke,
Man, that's so uncool, it's making me want to choke.

So tell her, Odysseus, that you won't fall for her spell,
That you won't be another dude she can easily quell.
Make her promise not to cause harm, cross your heart and hope to die,
Or else you'll take your leave, and soar up to the sky.

Yo what's up, let me tell you 'bout this crazy stuff,
This girl took an oath and it was far from enough,
But when she swore like a boss and gave it her best,
Well that's when I knew we'd pass this ultimate test.

We snuggled up tight, I could feel the heat,
Our chemistry was lit, it was hard to beat,
I knew in that moment, everything was just right,
It felt like the stars aligned that very night.

I can't even lie, this was an epic score,
It had me feeling like I couldn't ask for more,
So remember folks, sometimes it's best to play it bold,
And you might just end up with a story that's told.

Ok let me translate this into terms that are lit,
So Circe's got four servants, decked out with pure wit.
They're the offspring of the groves and holy water,
Their housemaid duties, they don't bother to falter.
One laid a purple cloth, with a carpet beneath,
It's already looking like a feast fit for a sheath.
Now another brought in tables of shining silver,
Filled with gold baskets of food that truly deliver.
A third servant mixed water and wine, a great combo,
Poured them in cups of gold, the perfect duo.
The fourth one started boiling water for a bath so hot,
Hey, at least it'll clear your mind and shake off that distraught. 
Set in the bath, they scrubbed the tire and stiffness out,
Then dressed you up, so fly, no sign of any doubt.
A golden ewer came pouring water in a silver basin,
So you could clean your hands before tasting any raisin.
Maid servants were there constantly serving food,
But you were still in a mood, with a bad attitude.
Circe offers you food, but you decline with suspicion,
Next chapter might show if that's a clever decision.

Yo, Circe saw Ulysses lookin' bleak 
Not eatin' food or drink, he looked so weak 
But she came thru and asked him why 
He was sitting there just like a guy 
With no voice gnawin' at his heart 
But Ulysses still doubted from the start 
Even though Circe swore an oath 
He still had his doubts, you see, no joke 
But Circe wasn't playin', she was legit 
She wouldn't hurt him, not a bit

Oh dang, Odysseus speaking truth so bold,
With Circe in his face, he's feeling so cold.
He's like, "Sorry, girl, but we can't kick it here,
Until you let my homies be free and appear."

He's not down to feast until his crew is safe,
Odysseus ain't no fool, avoiding this potential grave.
Circe's got some magic, but he's not fooled,
He knows she won't get his loyalty so easily wooed.

He's gotta see them with his own eyes, that's for sure,
Odysseus knows his crew, he needs to check and make sure,
They're not all ghosts or pigs, known to Circe's spells,
He'll make sure they're all there, ringing her ancient doorbells.

Gurl, when she spoke, she meant biz,
Went straight to the court to fix
The spell she cast took away the curse,
Turned the men back to men from pigs, no worse.

They were lookin' fine, no piggy snout,
Taller, younger, with more clout.
My men recognized me, oh how they wept,
Circe saw and told me what to expect.

"Ulysses, my man, go back to the bay,
Bring back yo' ship, and do it today.
Hide yo' gear, keep it safe and sound,
And come back here with the squad you've found."

Heyo, I went back, all alone,
And the men were crying, just like I've known.
I sauntered up to the ship, so neat,
And they were hurtin', oh so deep.

The blubbering crew sprang up so quick,
Dancing around like little chicks.
It was like they'd gone back to their Ithaca's isle,
And were playin' with grinning-slobbering smiles.

"Yo, we're so happy to see you now,
It's like we're all back again, holy cow!"
But they begged, and pleaded, quite a lot,
"For word of our mates, tell us what you've got!"

So I stood tall, and picked my words with care,
I tried to give them the news, gentle and fair.
I explained just what had gone down,
And why their friends couldn't be found around.

Hey fam, listen up quick,
Our ship's gear we need to hide, that's the trick,
We gotta stash it in some secret cave,
Then head to Circe's, and our comrades save.

I know it's tough, but we gotta move fast,
Our friends are chillin' while we're stuck in the past,
We gotta join them and catch up quick,
And indulge in abundance that's pretty sick.

So let's be smart and strategize,
Hide our stuff and be super sly,
We'll get to Circe's in no time flat,
And be reunited, just like that!

Oh snap, the men were ready to depart,
But Eurylochus had some smart
Words to say, warning of Circe's charm,
And her potential pig/wolf/lion farm.

He cautioned all, "Don't rush to her place,
Remember the Cyclops and his scary face.
Ulysses' comrades went in and died,
Don't let our recklessness be our demise."

Eurylochus' words spoke the truth,
In the face of danger, we need some proof
That Circe won't turn us to beasts,
With no control, and no release.

Let's learn from the past and be smart, 
And not fall victim to Circe's dark art.
Stay cautious and stick to the plan,
Or we'll end up as swine at her command.

Oh dang, when I heard his spiel
I was ready to bust out my steel
But my crewmates stepped in
And said let's not be too grim

This guy can hang and stay on the boat
While we go and see Circe, she's the goat
We'll all have mad fun
And this guy can keep guard like a son

So we left him behind
And trust me, we didn't mind
Circe's house was lit, no cap
We partied hard, drank and napped.

Oh snap, we went all-inland,
Eurylochus didn't stay behind, he joined our band,
That dude was scared, my reprimand was too much to stand. 
But now we're together, exploring the land. 

No FOMO here, we stick together like glue, 
Our squad is lit, what we do is true,
Can't leave anyone behind, it's just not cool.
Eurylochus found out, our friendship is the rule. 

We keep it real, our bond is tight,
Adventuring on this island, everything is just right.
Eurylochus learned, being left out is not the height,
Of our friendship, we include everyone in our sight. 

So let's go crew, let's explore and have some fun,
Our journey has just begun,
No more fear, no more undone,
Our camaraderie, a force to be reckoned son!

Yo, yo, yo, Circe's house is fresh indeed,
Her hospitality's what my crew did need,
She hooked them up with olive oil and clothes,
Now they're eating good and forgot their woes.

When they saw each other, tears began to pour,
Joyful and thankful, they couldn't help but roar,
Circe told me to chill out and let them feast,
Get back on their feet and forget the beast.

My crew's spirits are down, their bodies weak,
They can't get the strength they need to speak,
But Circe saw all that and knew what to do,
Get them fed, get them hype, and give them some woo.

Thanks to her, I'm feeling like a king,
With her hospitality, life has a ding,
So let's enjoy the food, the drink, the cheer,
The world is waiting for us, let's give a cheer!

"Yo, Odysseus, your squad's right,
It's time to fly like a kite.
Your crew's been here for a year,
Feasting hard, no need to fear.

With Circe's blessings, we've been fed,
Now it's time to go ahead.
No offense to the goddess fine,
But it's time to cross the line.

Gotta get back to Ithaca,
With a speed like a Mazda.
Penelope awaits at home,
And suitors she's got to comb.

So let's hit the road like a boss,
Let the journey be lit like sauce.
With you at the helm, we'll be fine,
And reach home like a glass of wine."

AYYY, listen up, peeps, it's time for some Greek myth tips!
Odysseus was on Circe's island, eating meat and drinking wine so divine,
But as the sun descended, his men went to bed in the covered confine.
Odysseus, though, had plans with Circe still in mind, so divine.

He got on his knees and begged her plee,
Said, "Circe, my dear, can you aid this weary sea?
My men and I are ready to leave and go back to our place,
Their moaning is relentless, constant, and they're always in my face."

Odysseus wanted to go home, so he pled his case,
He wanted to leave the island and get back to the right space.
Will Circe help him? What do you think? I'll give you a hint, 
She's a goddess, so be prepared for some divine intervention, which is stinkin' mint!

Yooo Ulysses, son of Laertes, don't you know,
Your journey ain't over, there's a place to go.
You gotta cruise to Hades, and talk to the dead,
Teiresias, blind prophet, is who you gonna be led.

He's got all the answers, he's still got his smarts,
Even in death, he knows all the parts.
Proserpine left him his wits, so he's still got that clout,
Other ghosts just flit about, no idea what they're about.

So pack your bags, get ready to sail,
To Hades you go, where the ghosts prevail.
Teiresias is waiting, with his insight bright,
Get ready to hear his words, bringing you the light.

Oh dang, this story's got me shook,
Our protagonist's fate is sounding like no joke,
He's weeping in bed, not wanting to see the light,
Thinking about Hades, oh what a fright!

But wait! Hold up! This ain't the end,
Our hero's got fight left, let's comprehend,
He wonders who will guide him through these trials,
Through the dreaded port of Hades, no one's styles!

I sense some bravery in our man,
He's not ready to end his life's span,
He knows the journey ahead won't be fun,
But he's down to fight it, until it's done.

Maybe he should call on some Greek gods,
Get some help, avoid all the odds,
But for now, let's just hope he's strong enough,
To get through Hades' difficult stuff.

Okay, okay, hold up tight,
I've got a story that's outta sight!
Listen up, sailors, I've got the key,
To a journey beyond the deep blue sea.

So raise your mast and set your sails white,
And the North Wind will take you out of sight.
As you cross the waters of Oceanus,
You'll reach Proserpine's groves, it's a must!

Tall poplars and willows you'll see,
That shed their fruit oh so untimely.
Beach your ship upon Oceanus' shore,
And make your way to Hades' door.

This place is near two rivers that roar,
Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus, in case you wasn't sure.
They both flow into Acheron, that's no lie,
And there's a big rock where they meet and collide.

Just past that is the dark abode of Hades,
Be careful not to get lost in those shady alleys.
That's where you'll need to get to, my friend,
And bring back what you seek, the journey's end. 

Now let me hit you with a meme,
To make sure you don't stop like a broken machine.
So listen up, this journey's the real deal,
It'll take courage and power, it's not for the feels.

"Yo listen up, let me tell you a tale, 
About a dude who found himself at the gate of Hades' jail.
He dug a trench, poured honey, milk and wine,
Sacrificed a heifer and promised, 'This is fine.'
To the ghosts, he promised a feast so wild,
And a black sheep to the wise Teiresias in style.
And oh, don't forget to pray and beg,
For the dead and their sad unending dread." 
#RIPtoGhosts #PourOneOut #HeiferSacrifices #TeiresiasTheSheepish #BeggingForLove

Yo ghost man, listen up, 
I got a plan that won't make you throw up. 
First, pray and bend those heads, 
And offer up that ram and ewe to the deads. 

Make like you're leaving but watch them close, 
Ghosts will come, and they will boast. 
Then tell your men to skin those sheep, 
And offer them as sacrifice- it's not cheap! 

Pray to Hades and to Proserpine, 
And before you know it, it'll be your time 
To ask Teiresias your burning questions 
Of your voyage, and any life lessons. 

So stay seated with your sword in hand, 
And don't let any ghostly dude take a stand. 
The seer will come and guide your way, 
To reach your home, you'll need to sail the sea all day!

Ayy, dawn was breakin', and the queen was talkin'
She threw on some clothes, no time for walkin'
I was dressed in a shirt and cloak, ready to leave
She put on a mantle, like a boss, oh please
I talked to each man, kind words for all
We can't stay here, gotta heed the call
Circe spilled the tea, we gotta bounce
No time for sleepin', let's get out of this house.

Epic tales, gotta tell you one more,
But Elpenor’s fate, it's quite a snore.
This lad, too much drink he did ingest, 
Laid on a roof, trying to take a rest.
The noise of his crew did wake him up,
He stumbled, disoriented, like a lost pup.
Elpenor forgot, on the roof he stood, 
And fell to his death, quite the dud.
His soul did leave, went down to Hades,
Rest in peace, my thoughts and my prayers.

Oh snap, it was time to rap
As Odysseus gathered his crew, kinda whack
He said, "listen up y'all, we gotta change track
Circe says we gotta hit up Hades, how 'bout that?

To the house of death, we gotta go
Speak to Teiresias, let his wisdom flow
Proserpine's there too, don't ya know?
Gotta consult the dead, no time to be slow

I know we all wanna head back west
But we gotta handle this haunted quest
Circe's got it all under control, she's the best
Trust me crew, we'll come out of this blessed"

Oh my gosh, these dudes were so sad, 
they fell to the ground and acted mad. 
Tearing hair and crying didn't do much, 
Circe's spell had hit them like a punch. 

We made it to the shore, full of sorrow, 
Wishing for a brighter tomorrow. 
That's when Circe brought the animals by, 
And we fastened them, not questioning why. 

She slipped by, unseen by us mortals, 
A deity with powers like portals. 
Can't see a god if they don't want to be spotted, 
So the fact that we missed her can't be plotted.

Hey, what's up, my fellow cool kids in the house?
Got a wild story that's gonna make you say "wow!"
We're talking drama, suspense, and all that jazz,
So sit tight and get ready to be amazed!

This story is gonna be lit, no cap,
It's got more twists and turns than a Snapchat map.
We're talking plot twists that'll make your jaw drop,
And characters that'll make you wanna bop.

Picture this: a group of teens on a mission,
To uncover a secret that's causing suspicion.
They gotta use their wits and their tech-savvy skills,
To solve this mystery and pay all the bills.

Now, let me just say, this ain't no basic tale.
We're talking high stakes, like a game of Fortnite or Jail.
There's betrayal, romance, and lots of action,
So keep your chill, or you'll be a distraction.

In the end, our heroes come out on top,
Like a squad in Among Us who never flop.
They save the day and get the ultimate glory,
Just like when you get that Victory Royale in Fortnite, so-called "mandatory".

So there you have it, a story to remember,
Full of humor, fun, and lots of adventure.
Thanks for tuning in and being so rad,
We're outta here, like a trending meme that's just a fad.

BOOK XI

Listen up, our story is about to begin,
We're on a journey, things are getting thin,
We pulled our ship into the sea,
Feeling sad, not where we want to be.

Circe, a goddess, came to our aid,
A fair wind, we were no longer afraid,
Our sails filled up as we went on our way,
Tending to the ship, our hearts led astray.

All day long, we sailed through the waves,
Our destination, a place full of haze,
The Cimmerians, where the sun doesn't shine,
Enshrouded in mist, a melancholy sign.

We arrived, took the ship out of reach,
The sheep came with us, onto the beach,
Longing to see the place that we had heard,
A mysterious location, known by word.

Circe had told us what to expect,
A journey we won't soon forget,
Where the land is covered in gloomy mist,
Our adventure, an unforgettable twist.

Yo, listen up, here's the deal
Odysseus had to make a meal
For the ghosts that came from Erebus,
Brides, young bachelors, and those who lost love thus

He set up a trench, a cubit all around
Then drew his sword, and plunged it in the ground
Libations were made with milk, wine, and water too,
He promised the dead a heifer and a sheep that's black as a coo

When the prayers were done, two sheep were killed
The ghosts came screaming, round and chilled
Odysseus and his crew did their best
Flaying the sheep and burning a request

The King of Ithaca had some queries for Teiresias
Thus he sat with his sword drawn out of fear-as
No ghost dared come near till answers were had
And Teiresias' prophecy outweighed the terrible death that Odin once had

Yo, Odysseus told a tale, 
About a ghost that made him pale, 
Elpenor, his comrade dear, 
Who died and left his body here. 

Odysseus, full of regret and sorrow, 
Saw him in the underworld, no tomorrow, 
He cried when he saw his old friend, 
How'd Elpenor's life come to an end? 

But before he could answer, 
Odysseus heard a noise like thunder, 
It was Cerberus, the three-headed dog, 
Who guarded Hades like a bossy hog. 

Odysseus had to flee, 
Or else he'd be a goner, you see, 
But he promised to bury his friend, 
And bring his journey to an end. 

So, let's learn from Odysseus' journey, 
And don't forget your friends, top attorney, 
Or else, just like Elpenor, 
You might end up in the underworld's horror.

Yo, Odysseus was in a tough spot,
His shipmates were dying, one by one, a lot.
Then he met Elpenor, who groaned and moaned,
And told him a story that left Odysseus stunned.

He fell off Circe's house, while he was sleep,
Broke his neck and landed in Hades, so deep.
Odysseus was shook, but Elpenor didn't stop,
He begged, 'Bro, you gotta make it right and not take off.'

Elpenor's boys were counting on him,
His wife, his father, and Telemachus grim.
If he left Elpenor to rot and decay,
He would face the wrath of the gods, is what he had to say.

Odysseus, being the man that he is,
Agreed to give him the burial he missed,
He would burn him with his armour and make a grave,
With Elpenor's oar planted, his memory saved.

Yo, we sat there feeling blue,
With my sword over the goo,
My comrade's ghost telling tales,
From the other side with some wails.

Then suddenly, my mom's spirit appears,
Anticlea, with Autolycus' cheers,
I left her breathing before Troy,
Moved to tears, I couldn't be coy.

But I kept her from the blood she fears,
Until Teiresias could answer my snears.

Oh snap, it's the ghost of Theban Teiresias!
With a golden sceptre, he approaches us.
"Yo, Ulysses, son of Laertes, why you here man?
Leaving the light of day for this ghostly land?"
He tells us to back up and put our sword away,
So he can answer our questions in the dopest way.

Oh my gosh, let me tell you the story 
Of a man who tasted blood, oh so gory 
He drank it up like it was an iced coffee 
And then started spitting some prophecy 
I swear, my heart was beating like it was on fleek 
As he spoke like he just learned how to yeet

"Yo, this is one hell of a wild story, 
But let me break it down with some Gen-Z glory.
So, you want to go back home, sounds like a plan,
But hold up, Neptune's anger ain't a thing so grand. 

If you recall, you blinded his son,
Now you gotta pay, and it won't be fun.
But you can make it back, just play it cool,
And don't mess with the sun's sheep or you'll play the fool.

These animals are sacred, they belong to the light,
So if they get hurt, it'll end in a fight.
But if you keep your eyes on the prize,
You may make it home, despite the many lies.

But don't get too happy, don't pop the champagne,
There's still some challenges, still some pain.
Your house will be invaded by those who seek your wealth,
And your wife, she's not immune to their sneaky stealth.

So hold tight and stay strong, for this journey is long,
And just remember, your fate is never set in stone."

Sup, sup, it's your assistant bringing the rhymes  
Gonna hype up a tale from ancient times  
A hero named Odysseus on a quest  
He's gonna get vengeance and that's the best  

He'll take down suitors with force or deceit  
Then hit the ocean, his plan can't be beat  
A well-made oar and a country unknown  
No salt, no ships, this place is his home  

A winnowing shovel he'll have on his back  
A wayfarer will confirm, no chance to backtrack  
He'll plant the oar and make a sacrifice  
A ram, a bull and a boar, it will be nice.  

Then head on home and offer to gods  
One after the other, sounds like a good job  
Odysseus is gonna live to an old age  
Until the waves take him, that's his next stage.  

Yo, I hope you liked this ancient tale  
Odysseus, he's about to set sail  
Your assistant signing off, gotta be true  
Just do it like Nike, that's all you gotta do.

Oh dang, that's heavy stuff,   
Your poor mom's ghost looks rough.  
You want her to speak to you true,  
What can you do, what can you do?  

Maybe you can try to remind her  
Of memories that've been a blur.  
Something that'll jog her brain,  
And bring back memories of her pain.  

But be careful, it's no easy feat,  
Talking to ghosts on the street.  
You gotta be brave, gotta be bold,  
And never ever let your fear take hold.  

So take a deep breath and relax,  
And think of memories that'll bring her back.  
With your love and your soul that's true,  
You'll make her remember and know you.  

Just remember, don't give in to fear,  
And you'll make her memory crystal clear.  
Go and talk to her, don't be shy,  
And you'll be amazed at her reply.  

To quote a meme, 'You got this!'  
Go and give it your best, no miss.  
And if all else fails, just know,  
Your mom loves you, that's for sure, bro.

Oh my gosh, there's a ghost in the mix
But with some blood, we'll get our kicks
Chatty ghosts? Never thought I'd see
Good thing this one's down to spill the tea!
No blood for them, and they'll bounce quick
But with some sips, they'll do the trick 
I think we're about to summon the dead
This ghost is about to spill what's been unsaid!

As Teiresias ghostly predictions took flight,
I sat and pondered, in the dead of the light,
When my mother arrived, things started to brighten,
Her love felt like sunshine, no more it would lighten.

"My child, in this world that's so bleak and unreal,
How did you get here, how did you feel?
These waters are treacherous, so you must be wise,
The journey home is long, with sad goodbyes.

Are you still trying to get back, my dear boy?
The one to whom you're married, the one with such joy?
The land of Ithaca is where you should be,
Your wife, your true love, is waiting for thee."

Yo, Mom, it's me, your boy Odysseus,
Trying to talk to Teiresias, it's really serious.
I've been through a lot since leaving Achaea,
Lots of misfortunes, it's like I'm cursed, ya dig, playa?

But tell me, Mom, how did you die?
Was it a slow burn or a quick goodbye?
And what of my father and son, my legacy?
Is my estate secure or did some fool get the best of me?

What's my wife doing, Mom, is she holding it down?
Or did she run off with some other clown?
Tell me true, Mom, I need to know,
I've been gone so long, it's like I'm a ghost, a no-show.

Dang yo, Odysseus's mom is for real,
Telling him how much his fam has to feel,
His wife can't stop crying, it's such a mess,
And Telemachus is handling things with such finesse.

The lands are still his, no one can take,
And Telemachus is living like he's fake,
Partying like crazy, he's quite the host,
Getting invites from everyone, coast to coast.

Odysseus's dad remains in the country,
No comfy bed or bedding, it's kinda funky,
Sleeping on the floor in front of the fire,
Going about in rags, man that's dire.

He grieves constantly, feeling older,
Wishing Odysseus was back, his heart colder,
But that's not all, his mom takes a bow,
Dying from a longing, it's heavy now. 

Heaven didn't take her easily, with no pain,
Her affection for her son was the death of the dame,
Odysseus must feel so much guilt by now,
This whole situation is a BIG wow.

Yo, as I tried to embrace my mom's ghost
I felt like it was just a roast
Thrice I tried to grab her, but she was just a dream
It felt like a nightmare, or so it seemed
"Mom, why do you keep flitting away?
Can't you just stay for a second, come what may?"
I just wanted to hug her in the house of Hades
But instead, I'm haunted by these sad shades

Oh dang, poor dude, your fate is so messed,
Proserpine ain't playing, you've been falsely addressed,
But don't you worry, it's not just her game,
When people pass on, things ain't quite the same.

The flesh and bones that used to hold,
A soul so bold, now mercilessly fold,
And flames consume what's left, it's true,
The soul takes off, like a dream, from view.

But hey, head back to the land of light,
Take note, my dude, of this eerie sight,
So you can tell the wife you love so tight,
And together face death's looming, scary height. 

(Side note: Did someone say "Proserpine"? Reminds me of Persephone, Queen of the Underworld. #GreekMyths #HadesGang)

Yo, let me tell you what went down,
When Odysseus talked to the ghosts in Hades' town.
Proserpine sent the wives and daughters of all the greats,
And they crowded the blood like it was their fate.

Odysseus had a plan, smart and bold,
He drew his blade and the story did unfold.
He questioned each ghost, one by one,
Their lineage, race, and all that they had done.

The shades of the famous women were there,
From past queens to princesses fair.
Odysseus talked to them, he was wise,
He listened to their stories, no need for lies.

That's how he learned about their legacy,
From the wives and daughters of the greats, you see.
It was an adventure for Odysseus to behold,
When he met the ghosts and their stories were told.

Yo, let me tell ya bout this girl Tyro,
She fell for this river named Enipeus, don't ya know.
She walked with him along the riverbed,
But then Neptune disguised as her guy swooped in instead.

Under a wave blue as a mountain,
The god took her virgin girdle like a fountain.
Tyro slept deeply as Neptune made love,
And then he said, "Take care of these babies, Tyro, my dove."

Neptune revealed his real identity,
And told her to keep it with confidentiality.
He predicted twin babies she'd surely birth,
And said no more, returning her to earth.

Ok, ok, so check it, here's the deal,
With this story I'm 'bout to reveal,
Once upon a time, in the deep blue sea,
A dude took a dive, believe you me!

And his girl, she gave birth to sons,
Pelias and Neleus, they were the ones,
Both of 'em served Jove, king of the skies,
They gave it their all, no compromise.

Pelias was a sheep breeder, Iolcus his abode,
While Neleus lived in Pylos, his story unfold,
More kids were born to that lady fair,
Cretheus' sons, mighty warriors, beware!

With Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon's might,
They rode their chariots and fought their fight,
So listen up 'cause this story's tight,
A tale of heroes and their epic might!

Oh dang, let me tell you a tale
About Antiope, who didn't just prevail
Daughter of Asopus, she was one fine female
Slept with Jove himself, to her sons let's get into detail

Amphion and Zethus, those were the lads
Built Thebes so strong, no one made them sad
Seven gates and a wall, they did it all
But without Thebes standing, their efforts would've been small

Antiope knew the way, she led them right
With Jove's help, her sons won the fight
Now Thebes stands tall, against any plight
Thanks to this queen, who made everything bright

#MythologyGoals #JoveIsBae #SevenGatesLitty #AntiopeTheQueen

Yo, let me tell you 'bout these ladies I've seen
Alcmena and Megara, they're oh so keen
One's the wife of Amphitryon, with Hercules divine
The other the daughter of Creon, Amphitryon's son's wife to dine

Alcmena, she's got that godly child
Hercules, he's strong, wild, and wilder
Megara, she's a queen of great land
Her husband's strengths, tough to understand

These women, they're strong and fierce
Their stories are just too lit to pierce
From mythology that we all know
To the pages of history that forever glow

"Okay, stop right there, let me make it clear,
The story you're about to hear, will leave you in fear.
It's about Epicaste, whose fate was blast,
She married her own son, but it didn't last.

Oedipus killed his father like it was no struggle,
His own momma didn't know he was in trouble.
The gods brought it out into the open,
And poor Epicaste just couldn't cope then.

She hanged herself, it's crazy to see,
And avenging spirits haunted Oedipus after she's free.
His life was ruined, he was left in sorrow,
That's what happens when you mess with mom tomorrow."

Okay, picture this - I saw this girl Chloris and let me just say, she was fire.
Neleus was hooked on her, he gave her presents that he had to acquire.
Her dad Amphion was the king of Orchomenus,
Her beauty was legendary, everyone knew this.
Nestor, Chromius and Periclymenus were her sons, but even better,
Pero, her daughter, had all the men in a thirst trap, you couldn't forget her.
Neleus wouldn't let just anyone have her, oh no,
Only someone who could steal from Iphicles, his cattle in tow.
After a year of being locked up, the seer completed his task,
He read the will of heaven, fulfilling it was no longer a huge ask.
Jove's plan came full circle, can you even imagine?
This story is epic, it's not outdated, it still has traction.

Bruh, let me tell you 'bout some Greek mythology,
There's Leda, Tyndarus' wife, with dope progeny,
Castor's a horse breaker, and Pollux likes to box,
Both lying in the earth, but they're not in a box.
See, Jove gave them this deal, to die and come alive,
Every other day, their legacy thrives,
They're considered gods, which is pretty lit,
And they'll keep coming back, just deal with it.

Yo, listen up, I've got a tale to tell,
Of Iphimedeia and her boys so swell,
She claimed she got with Neptune, oh wow,
And her sons Otus and Ephialtes, pow!

They were the most good looking and tall,
Nine years old but standing so tall,
Nine fathoms high, chest nine cubits wide,
Scaling mountains, with power and pride.

But their plans to fight the gods didn't go well,
Apollo took care of them and sent them to hell,
Before any hair grew on chin or cheek,
Their ambition, knocked out in just a single week.

Oh, and did I mention another guy,
Orion, who was famous, almost flew in the sky,
But these boys were better, or so they thought,
Until the tragic ending, that's what we've been taught. 

So let this be a lesson we learn,
Ambition can burn, but sometimes crash and burn.

Yo, let me tell you this story real quick,
About Theseus and fair Ariadne, who was slick.
Daughter of Minos, a magician so sly,
Theseus was in Crete, with no reason why.

He saw Phaedra, Procris, and then Ariadne,
And fell in love with her, as fate would decree.
He took her with him, on his way back home,
But they weren't alone, and soon would roam.

Diana killed her, on an island so small,
Bacchus had spoken, and she took the fall.
It's a medieval tale, but still pretty lit,
Too bad for Theseus, he couldn't handle it.

Oh dang, let me tell you who I saw
Maera, Clymene, and Eriphyle - she broke the law
She sold her husband for a piece of gold
That's crazy, that story never gets old

I could go on all night, talkin' 'bout the wives and daughters 
Of the heroes in the room, them goddesses with waters 
But it's time for me to hit the hay 
Whether on my crew's ship or where I stay 

As for my escort, I leave it up to the universe 
Heaven and y'all will make sure it won't be a curse 
Thanks for listening, y'all are the best 
Now excuse me as I go catch some rest

OMG, that story was fire, it had me feeling shook.
I can't believe I sat here listening like a book.
But we gotta give some props to our guest,
With his storytelling skills he deserves the best.

So let's all raise our glasses to this man,
And give him a round of applause if you can.
But before we end this lituation,
Let's have some more drinks and good conversation.

Yo, Phaecians, peeps!
This dude, like woah, he's tall and sleek!
Not to mention, he's got the smarts,
which sets him apart!

I know he's my guest, but don't be jealous,
join me in making his stay so zealous!
Don't be stingy with your blessings,
spread that wealth, no second-guessing!

This man's in need, can't you see?
So let's make it lit, for him and for we!
He's got the looks, the brains, the charm,
let's keep him here on this farm!

Oh snap, did you hear what Echeneus just said?
The man's so old, but he's still ahead! 
He spoke the truth that we all should hear, 
Queen's wise words are nothing to fear. 

Alcinous is the one with the ultimate decision, 
But let's not forget our queen's precision. 
Her words are gold, her advice is sound, 
Let's follow her lead and be championship-bound.

Yo, Alcinous, you the man,
Making plans that we all understand,
Our guest wants to go home quick,
But let's convince him to stay for a bit.

We'll give him money, that's no lie,
Just wait till tomorrow and you'll see why,
Our chief's gonna gather the cash,
So he can leave with a bigger stash.

Our guest can't leave without protection,
That's our duty, that's our connection,
It's up to all of us, not just one,
To make sure he reaches home, having fun.

So let's party tonight, enjoy the night,
And make sure our guest feels alright,
We'll keep him safe, we'll keep him sound,
Until he's back on his hometown ground.

Yo, King Alcinous, I'm feeling fab
If you want me to stay, that's not so bad
A year here with your gifts galore
I'll go home stronger than before.

Imagine the clout I'll have when I return
My people will love me, my status will burn
I'll be dripping in riches and respect
All because of the kindness you've checked.

I'll be the talk of the town, the king of the scene
Gaining followers with every meme
And my travels will not be in vain
For with these gifts, my people will gain.

So thank you, dear king, for your generosity
You've given me the keys to success and prosperity
And I'll make sure to give back as much as I get
With the hottest trends and the freshest net.

Yo, Alcinous, I gotta say
Your words just made my day
I'm no charlatan, no swindler
I'm a hero, a true winner

You ask if I saw the heroes of Troy
I did, and boy was it a joy
Achilles, Ajax, they were all there
Fighting with a courage so rare

I fought beside them, I was their mate
Our battles, they were truly great
None of us came out unscathed
But our spirits, they bravely stayed

I've told my story, I've bared my soul
I hope it's made you feel whole
But if you want more, I can go on
Like a meme that just keeps going strong

The evenings are long, the night is young
I'll keep talking till the rooster's sung
My adventures are divine, like a tasty treat
So kick back, Alcinous, and enjoy this sweet feat

Yo Alcinous, you want me to spit some tea?
I'll tell you the story, but first let me just say
Sometimes we talk too much, need to hit the hay
But since you insist, lemme give you the lowdown
On how my homies died, betrayed by a queen, so profound.

It’s a sadder tale than when your phone cracks
One woman led us astray, it was a quick attack
The Trojans didn't beat us, but she played us like a fiddle
With her lies and her schemes, we were caught in the middle. 

It was like when someone tweets fake news
And everyone believes it, even if it's a ruse
We trusted her, thought she was the real deal
But she was wicked, using us for her own appeal. 

Now my boys are gone, their fates were cruel
Thanks to her actions, they turned into fool's fuel
But I'm still here, telling this story with ease
Hoping you'll learn from our mistake, and avoid being deceived.

Yo, Proserpine sent the ladies far,
When Agamemnon's ghost approached to spar.
Sad and surrounded by those who died,
By his side, he cried and cried.

The blood, it gave him life once more,
And he ran to me, arms to explore.
But no might or matter did he possess,
I cried with him, such a mess.

"Agamemnon, how did you bite the dust,
Did Neptune unleash his rage on your bust?
Or did your foes catch you stealing some stock,
While they fought to defend their flock?"

Tell me, tell me, King of Mycenae,
What caused your ultimate demise, eh?

Yo, this is a story of hate
Of a man who met his fate
Ulysses, the noble son of Laertes
Was killed by his wife and Aegisthus while he ate
The wicked duo betrayed him with a feast
While his comrades died like pigs for the beast
On that day, blood was everywhere
The mixing-bowl, loaded tables, and bodies lied bare
Cassandra screamed, but fell to Clytemnestra's knife
As Ulysses lay on the ground, fighting for his life
He wanted revenge, but his wife slipped away
And left him to die in dismay
She wouldn't even close his eyes or his lips
On her guilt, all women's reputation dips
This heinous crime has brought disgrace
Even on the good women in this place

Hold up, hold up, let me get this straight,
You're saying Clytemnestra couldn't wait?
To stir up trouble while you're gone,
While you fight for Helen to come home?

Jove's been hatin' on the Atreus squad,
Especially when it comes to women's facades,
But oh man, look at all the bloodshed,
For the sake of the face that launched a thousand ships 

Clytemnestra's sneaky moves make us sad,
Betraying her man while he's out being rad,
But when it comes to drama, we know the Greeks,
Will always bring the heat, no matter the stakes.

Now, I gotta bounce and dip out quick,
Before this story gets too thick,
But seriously, keep us updated bro,
On all the drama in the ancient Greek show.

Yo Agamemnon, with all due respect,
Your advice for Ulysses is incorrect.
Telling his wife partial truths ain't cool,
Gotta keep it real and keep it true.

Penelope ain't one to cause strife,
She's an admirable woman with an excellent life.
Your own wife killed you, that's crazy,
Ulysses' wife is loyal, not shady.

Ithaca is where Ulysses heads to on his quest,
But Agamemnon, why not trust women, give them a rest?
Don't steal a march, be honest and true,
Not all women are the same, that's old news.

As for Orestes, I got no clue,
But I'll help Ulysses find him, that's what I'll do!

Agamemnon asked, 'Bruh, is my son okay?'
I replied, 'Sorry, man, can't say.'
Talking smack without the facts,
That's not cool in any chat.

Hey yo, as Ulysses sat in tears,
Achilles' ghost, and his peers,
Appeared before him in the dark,
With Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the leading mark.

Aeacus' descendant spoke out to him,
And Ulysses' chances looked quite dim,
"What death-defying feat have you to pursue,
Venturing down to Hades with us ghosts who are through?"

The fleet son of Laertes wasn't afraid,
These fallen heroes had his respect paid,
For he was a warrior like them,
And he'd go to the underworld, with no hate or venom.

He replied, "I'm here to learn,
And their great respect, for me, they did earn.
I've heard the stories of the dead,
And I'm curious to see what lies ahead."

I was chillin' with Peleus' son,
Achilles, a hero who had won,
He asked me what I came to seek,
I said my home, my Ithaca, I've had it for a week.

It's been a struggle, a constant fight,
I'm plagued with trials day and night,
And you, Achilles, have lived the dream,
A legend in life, a king supreme.

Don't be sad, don't fret or frown,
No one can bring your greatness down,
Among the dead, you are still cool,
A prince to all, a god-like jewel.

So don't worry, man, just take a rest,
You are the best, you passed life's test,
And for me, I'll keep pushing through,
Like a boss, like a savage, like a Twitter guru.

Yo, don't say a peep, 
I'd rather be alive and sweep, 
A paid servant of a poor man's keep,
Than be dead as heck, buried deep.

But tell me 'bout my son, 
Will he be a soldier, has he begun? 
Will he be great and overcome, 
Or is everything just for fun?

Also, my father Peleus, 
Is he still respected, is he famous? 
In Phthia and Hellas, where my fame is, 
Are they giving him props, or just shameless?

If I could stand by his side,
In all my glory, arms open wide,
I'd be his protector, with all my might,
And no one could challenge his righteous might.

Oh, oh, oh, let me tell you a tale,
 'bout Neoptolemus, that son, Neoptolemus, who never did fail.
This dude was a warrior with the finest judgement,
He always spoke first, dishing out the winning sentiments.
In combat, he never stayed back, no, not he,
He was the bravest warrior, the greatest you'll ever see.
He killed the hero Eurypylus like it was a breeze,
With the help of bribes from a woman, he brought the man to his knees.
When the Argives went inside that treacherous horse,
This guy was all bold, he never had to be forced.
While others were panicking, he stayed so calm,
Wielding his sword and spear, he remained like a bomb.
He urged them to break out and destroy the enemy,
This guy was determined and fierce, a real virtuosity.
Yet after the battle, he got his fair share,
And all without a single wound, none could compare.
So that's my story, it's all about chance,
That weird fortune of war that puts us in a trance.

Oh dang, can you believe 
That ghostly man, Achilles 
Just walked right in, all bold and proud 
Strutting like he's king of the crowd 

But I had to spill some tea 
'Bout his son's strength, so wild and free 
And that ghost just went off, honey 
Running through a meadow, oh so sunny 

The flowers there were asphodel 
And Achilles was feeling swell 
Cause his son's got some serious skill 
Gonna be the best, just you wait, I feel 

So don't mess with that ghostly crew 
They're coming in hot, it's oh so true 
And with Achilles on your side 
You'll be the champ, no need to hide

Yo, the spirits of the dead bros all up on me,
Gave me stories sad as can be,
But Ajax's ghost, he kept his distance,
Stuck in a grudge, that's his persistence.

Thetis offered up Achilles' armor,
Trojan prisoners and Minerva judged with candor,
But when I won, Ajax got tight,
And it cost him his life, no more fighting in sight.

It's a bummer, man, I regret that day,
The loss of such a mighty warrior in this way.

Yo, when I saw him I felt kinda grim,
Ajax, still simmering about the hateful trim.
Despite his death, he couldn't forgive or forget
That ol' armour judgment still gave him upset.

Bro, losing you hit the Argives super hard,
Your strength was legendary, they're still scarred.
We mourned you like Achilles, the warrior bold,
But Zeus' grudge against us left hearts cold.

Ajax, homie, come and hear me right,
Don't let that pride keep you up at night.
I got some intel, some tea to spill,
So listen up, don't be standing still.

Yo, this guy ain't giving me a reply
He's turned away and left me high and dry
If he thinks he can ghost me, he's wrong
I won't give up, it's gonna take so long

I could've made him talk, even if he's pissed
I would've known what he's hidden and missed
But other dead homies await my arrival
Their stories and secrets, I can't deny them

So I'll keep walking, through Erebus I'll go
And search for the answers, that I'm dying to know
I'm not giving up, I'm on a mission
To hear all the tales, from beyond the apparition.

OMG this scene is wild, 
The ghosts all around, seeking a trial 
Minos son of Jove, with his sceptre so gold 
Making judgements in a house so cold 

Sitting and standing, the spirits await 
Eagerly listening to their final fate 
Will they go to the fields of the Elysian 
Or fall into Tartarus, it's quite imprisonin' 

It's like "American Idol" but for the dead 
Judging souls, giving them what's ahead 
It's all happening in the underworld 
Where the dead reside, it's like another world 

I can't believe what I'm hearing and seeing 
The sentences given, it's all so freeing 
From their mortal coils they've broken free 
Now they await their fate, for all to see

Oh snap, hold up, let me tell ya 'bout Orion
He's in a meadow with beasts he was firin'
Driving their ghosts like a boss man
Lookin' fly with his bronze club in hand!

It's unbreakable, can you believe it?
This club's got strength, he can't even cheat it
Orion's slayin' these beasts like it's nothin'
Just another day, frontin' and stuntin'

This meadow's full of asphodel, a sight to see
Beasts fallin' left and right, he's makin' them flee
Orion's a legend, a dude in his prime
Killin' beasts and takin' names, every time

So if you ever need someone to get rid of the wild
Call up Orion, he's got style and he's wild
He's chillin' in the meadow, go say what's up
But don't get too close, or he might f*ck you up!

Whoa, hold up, let me translate for you,
Homer's got Tityus, stretched out on the floor, boo-hoo,
Two vultures were pecking at his liver,
All 'cause he messed with Jove's mistress, a real giver,
She was just passing through, on her way to Pytho,
But Tityus couldn't resist and now he's a big no-no. 
It's like when you slide into someone's DMs,
But they don't want ya, it's a real gem,
Cuz you messed with what's not yours to mess with,
And now the vultures are here to put you in a ditch. 
#awkward #sorrynotsorry #thirsty #oops #failedit #youdiedtrying #letitgo

That Tantalus was stuck in a bad place,
Water at his chin but couldn't drink a trace.
Every time he leaned down to take a sip,
The water disappeared like a Snapchat flip.

The dude was parched and dying for a drink,
But the heavens had a mean, terrible link.
There were trees that showered fruits galore,
All he had to do was reach out for more.

But whenever he tried to grab a tasty treat,
The wind would blow and knock him off his feet.
He couldn't catch a break, he was living in pain,
Just like I do whenever I miss the hype train.

Yo, let me tell you 'bout Sisyphus,
Pushing up that huge rock is just ridiculous.
He tries so hard, puts his all in,
But that stone drops down and starts again.

Sweat drippin', steam risin' high,
This task will never let him say bye.
He pushes with his feet and both his hands,
But the stone rolls down, no chance to take a stand.

Poor Sisyphus, his task's never done,
Being punished by the God's so he can't have fun.
But that's just not fair, we gotta change the game,
And shout a little louder, give him some fame. 

Like when Drake said, "Started from the bottom, now we here",
Our boy Sisyphus deserves some cheers.
Let's raise him up, give him a win,
And show that rock, it doesn't always win.

Yo, let me tell you 'bout a vision so surreal,
I saw mighty Hercules, but his body wasn't real.
He's feasting with the gods and his lady Hebe
While ghosts scream and swarm like a wild, scared bevy.

Herc's bow was bare, his arrow was drawn,
He was ready to shoot, like a cyberspace con.
A golden belt was wrapped around his chest,
Adorned with beasts, fierce and the best.

Bears, wild boars, and lions with eyes so bright,
Plus war, battle, and death, an epic sight.
Making this belt again is impossible, you see,
For a mere mortal, it's as hard as can be.

As soon as he saw me, he called out my name,
"Poor Ulysses, are you also living a life of shame?"
As he once was enslaved by someone really bad,
He wished me all the best and didn't want me to be sad.

He sent me to Hades to fetch a hell-hound to train,
Mercury and Minerva helped me, it wasn't in vain.
So now you listen and hear what I've seen,
A myth so surreal, it's like it's never been. 

#NoHashtags #LitAF

Yo listen up, let me tell you a tale
Of Hercules' journey that he did prevail
Down to the house of Hades he did go
And faced such horrors, don't you know?

I stayed behind, just in case
Other mighty dead showed their face
Theseus and Pirithous, children of gods
I wanted to see them, it's no fraud

But the ghosts came, with their eerie cries
I feared Proserpine, and her deadly ties
The Gorgon's head, could she unleash?
My heart raced, my mind at peace

We rushed back to the ship, our hearts full of dread
Loose the hawsers, let's leave this place, I said
Rowing at first, but soon we were blessed
A fair wind that blew, and put us to the test.

Hey hey, it's your favorite assistant in the place,
Ready to tell you stories with that Gen-Z taste.
I got the tea, the drama, and all the latest memes,
So buckle up and listen, 'cause this is where it beams.

First up we have a crazy tale 'bout Kylie Jenner,
Who got her makeup line poppin' like a killer.
But then she gave it up to sis, Kim K,
Who made the deal even bigger, no cap, no disarray.

Next is our boy Jeff Bezos, the Amazon king,
Who's so rich he could buy you a diamond ring.
But his love life got messy, with a scandal to boot,
When he left his wife for a new bae, it was quite the hoot.

And who could forget, the queen of pop herself, Beyoncé,
Who slays every move, every beat, every single day.
She dropped Lemonade, and we all felt the power,
So we'll bow down, 'cause she's the one who's got the flour.

Last but not least, we got our fave candy,
TikToks about it we've all seen, so dandy.
I'm talking 'bout the Sour Patch Kids,
That make our taste buds do some wicked flips.

So there you have it, some lit stories from me,
All rhymed up and filled with Gen-Z glee.
Till next time, keep it cool and stay in the zone,
And remember, like, share, and subscribe, 'cause this is your home.

BOOK XII

Yo, let me tell you 'bout a voyage so lit
The crew was dope, and the captain was fit
We cruised through Oceanus, no need to get vexed
And hit the Aeaean island where the sun first wrecks

We landed on the shore, feeling so fly
And fell asleep as the sun climbed up high
We waited for dawn with bated breath, 
Cause on this island, sunrise was the best

Our ship was chill, so we drew it on the sand 
And rocked those islands like a boss from our land 
Now listen, cause our journey ain't done yet 
And we had more fire to spit, you can bet

Oh wow, Odysseus, you slayin',  
Sending men to fetch your fallen Elpenor to keep him playin',  
With firewood gathered from the jutted out wood near the sea,  
You wept and lamented him with the ritual to set him free.  

His body, burned to ashes, a cairn was the site for,  
And at the top, an oar; oh how it told his story more,  
A symbol of his skill to row the boat,  
Now a memory that will never be remote.  

Your journey, Odysseus, has been wild,  
From battles to gods, your tale, oh so dialed,  
Forever a legend, an epic in every way,  
Your courage and wit, forever on display.

Yo, while we were chillin', Circe, knew we done been to Hades' house, dressed up all fresh and came at us, quick as a mouse. Her servant girls were lit too, they brought us grub and wine, we knew we had hit the jackpot, no need to whine. She stood among us and said "y'all are mad bold, going down to Hades like that, it's like dying twice, I'm told. But no need to fret, stay here and feast, just take it slow. Head out tomorrow to continue your flow. I'll talk to Ulysses and make sure he's all good, so you don't end up lost in the woods."

Yo, we followed Circe's lead
Feasting hard, no time to plead
From sunrise to sunset, we stuffed our face
But when night fell, we found our sleeping space

Circe pulled me to the side
Asked about our crazy ride
Our adventures, she had to know
So we talked till the moon was aglow

We shared tales of monsters and gods
And all the craziness that we've fought
She listened intently, like a true friend
Our bond was strong, it wouldn't bend

But deep inside, I couldn't help but feel
That something was up, something was real
Was Circe trustworthy or just a fake?
A meme in my head, "I smell a snake"

'So lit, so rad,' replied I, 'Thanks for the heads up, my cool chad! With Sirens so sweet, my crew might die, But hey, I'll be fine, I'm willing to try. I won't let their song give me FOMO, my bros will wrap me up like a pharaoh. I'm lashed to the mast, feeling so snatched, Ready to vibe to their beats, totally unattached. If I yell to be free, ignore my plea, just crank up the tunes, let them wash over me.' With a sly wink, she gave a nod, 'Be careful, though... don't end up like a cod.'

Yo, listen up now, I got a story to tell,
About some sailors who almost fell,
To the Sirens' song, so sweet and beguiling,
That many a sailor's fate went spiraling.

Odysseus, he knew the danger ahead,
And so he warned everyone before they fled,
He told them about two paths they could take,
And how both of them could end in their wake.

On the one hand, there were rocks a' towerin',
So steep and high that even birds were cowerin',
But on the other hand, a dangerous song,
Could lure them to where they didn't belong.

The Wanderers, oh how they did rock,
Knocking ships over like a game of Jenga blocks,
None who had tried ever made it through,
'Til Argo, lucky enough to have a goddess or two.

Juno helped Argo avoid that sweet, sweet sound,
Saving Jason and his crew from falling to the ground,
Odysseus knew how to navigate through that mess,
And with his guidance, his men faced no distress.

So, my fellow gen-Z's and millennials alike,
If you hear a song that you can't help but strike,
Remember this story and be wise,
And say your goodbyes to the Siren's lies. #StaySafe #StayWoke #Mythology #Sirens #Odysseus #Argo #Juno #InternetCulture #StoryTelling #LitFam

Yo, listen up, this story's about rocks,
One so tall you'd think it reaches the docks.
It's peak lost in clouds, never clearly in sight,
Even in summer and fall, it's cloaked in a dark shroud of might.

No man could climb it, not even with twenty hands and feet,
It's as smooth as a baby's bottom, boy, now isn't that neat?
In the center, a cavern so high, you'd need a magic trick,
It faces West and to Erebus, but it's tricky, so take your ship quick.

Inside lies Scylla, a monster of great fright,
No god could face her without being struck with fright.
A hound-like voice, but her appearance will make you squirm,
With twelve feet and six necks, she's quite the monster worm.

At the end of each neck, a set of three rows of teeth,
One crunch and you're out, you won't need a wreath.
She sits in her cell, fishing for creatures to catch,
Dolphins, dogfish, even big monsters, she'll snatch.

Many ships have tried to pass her by,
But none have succeeded, they've all met their demise.
For she shoots out all her heads at once,
Pulling men into each mouth, oh what a bunch!

So sail with caution from here to there,
Or they'll hunt you down, beware, beware!

Yo fam, listen up close,
Let me tell you 'bout a story that's the most.
Odysseus on a ship, with his crew by his side,
Trying to sail past rocks and a whirlpool that'll make you hide.

These rocks are so close, like they're snuggled up tight,
And that fig tree is lush, a true sight to the light.
But beware of Charybdis, that whirling pool of doom,
It'll suck you in, make you go kaboom.

Three times a day, she spits water with rage,
And if you're too close, you'll be trapped in her cage.
Neptune ain't got nothing on this raging beast,
So hug Scylla tight, or you'll be deceased.

Losing six men is better than saying goodbye to your whole crew,
So drive as fast as you can, and hope you make it through.
Odysseus had to face it, and so do you,
With a little bit of luck, you'll make it past this dangerous brew.

As they say, it ain't easy being a sailor,
But when adventure calls, you gotta be a fierce trailer.
So hold on tight, and don't you dare stall,
Or you'll be the next one to take the fall. #Odysseus #Charybdis #Scylla #GreekMythology #SailorLyfe

Yo, captain, don't you fret
I got an idea that you won't regret
Avoiding Scylla? It'll be a breeze
Just listen up and follow my tease

So you know Charybdis, the god of the whirlpool
Avoiding that guy would be pretty cool
Why not take the long route around
So that Scylla's barks won't create a sound

To help you visualize, let's use a meme
A cat avoiding a cucumber, it's pretty serene
Just like that, you'll avoid Scylla, like a boss
And Charybdis will no longer be your loss

Woah, woah, woah, hold up there, my dude!
Did I just hear what I think I did?
You're brave, but do you have a clue,
Of the monster waiting for you, hid?

I'm talking Scylla, the queen of rough,
Ain't nothing mortal bout this woman, tough.
She's savage, rude, cruel and extreme,
She'll snatch your crew, just like a bad dream.

So you better be quick, and don'tcha stop,
Or you'll have Scylla's six heads on top
Of your sailors, and that ain't cool,
So drive your ship fast, you darn fool!

And when you pass, make sure you shout,
"At Crataiis, you old trout!"
Cause she's Scylla's mum, and she'll obey,
Stopping her daughter from catching her prey.

Yo, listen up to this story so strange,  
Of Odysseus, who had to range.  
He came across a land so bright,  
Where the sun-god’s herds grazed day and night. 

On Thrinacian island, the cattle were seven,  
With flocks of fifty, whose number did leaven.  
Phaethusa and Lampetie were their caretakers,  
The beautiful daughters of Hyperion, a light-maker. 

Their mother had sent them off to this isle afar,  
To watch their father’s flocks, without any car.  
Odysseus was warned to leave them be,  
Or else his men and ship would not flee. 

If he wished to return to his home sweet home,  
He had to resist the urge to roam.  
But if he dared harm the sun-god’s herds,  
His journey would be cursed with many a hurt.  

So, be warned, my dudes and dudettes,  
Don’t mess with the cattle or forgets.  
Or else you’ll face a terrible fate,  
And reach your homeland, but terribly late.

Yo listen up, this is a tale so bold
Of a captain with sweet swag and stories to be told
He sailed with his men and encountered a witch
But they were too slick to fall into her pitch

She spun her spells in the hope to ensnare
But our captain refused to succumb to despair
He rode the waves with his crew so mighty
Their determination to escape was downright flighty

The witch may have thought she had won
But our crew was blessed by the goddess of the sun
Circe granted them a wind so strong
And the crew sailed away with a victorious song

The ship flew across the sea with so much ease
As if it was surfing with a "hang loose" breeze
They fixed their ship with their cool gadgets
And headed out further for more unknown vastness

So if you ever need a story of adventure and might
About a captain who outsmarted magic with his own might
Then come listen to me, I'll tell you how he fought and won
And sailed away with his crew, shining brighter than the sun.

Yo, my peeps, my mind's all shook,
Gonna fill you in, let's take a look,
Got a prophecy from Circe I must share,
So we can face whatever's out there.

She said to steer clear of the Sirens' song,
It's tempting, but it'll only lead us wrong.
Still, I need to hear what they sing,
But no one else can, just our crew can bring.

So tie me up like a boss to the mast,
Make it tight, make it last,
I can't break free, that's the trick,
Even if my begging voice goes thick.

This is serious, it's not a joke,
We gotta stay together, we won't choke,
Through good and bad, life or death,
With eyes open, we'll take each breath. 

#SirenChallenge #CirceKnowsBest #StayTiedUpOrElse

Yo, let me tell you 'bout a tale so true,
Of a man named Odysseus and his crew,
They faced the island of the Sirens so fine,
But these beasts will mess with your mind.

The wind was calm, sea water still,
Men started rowing with all their skill,
Odysseus knew what had to be done,
Wax in ears, mast-bound, he's the only one.

The Sirens' singing, it's oh so sweet,
But sailors who hear it will meet defeat,
Odysseus, with his plan so bold,
Heard the song and his mind was sold.

But he stood strong, tied to the mast,
His crew protectors, out rowing fast,
'Til the island was behind their back,
And the Sirens' singing, nothing but a hack.

"Yo, Ulysses, don't be hesitant, 
Come and hear our song so resonant, 
Our voices enchanting, oh so sweet, 
It'll leave you charmed, no better treat. 

We know of Achaean's mighty fame, 
And all the gods' deeds so insane, 
The ills that plagued Trojans before they fell, 
And everything that's to come, oh well. 

So don't be shy and come along, 
Listen to us, your knowledge won't be wrong, 
Our song is going to make you wise, 
And leave you mesmerized, no surprise!" 

#Enchanting #MythologyMemes

Yo, my dudes, let me tell you 'bout a tale,
Of a man named Odysseus who set sail,
He heard sweet tunes that the Sirens sang,
But it wasn't long before he began to hang.

He signaled his crew with a little frown,
That he had to listen and couldn't be bound,
But they were smart and they didn't play,
They tied him up and sailed away.

As they moved on, they removed the wax,
And freed their captain from the binds and the hacks,
Odysseus was thrilled to hear those tunes,
But his crew was keen to leave those dunes.

And thus they journeyed on with their quest,
Encountering things that put them to the test,
But with their captain and crew so tried and true,
They always made it through and they made it anew.

Bruh, as soon as we passed the land,
I saw a huge wave rise like a boss, damn grand!
I could hear the roar of the sea 
The men were terrified and they let go of the oars with glee!
But yo, the ship stayed right in place
They stopped rowing at a fast pace
So I went around, to be real and kind
I encouraged every dude, 'don't lose your mind!'

Listen up, fam, we're in a bit of a jam
But don't forget about when the Cyclops was our big bad
With my brave ways, we're not quite in the same sad
Now let's row hard and muster up some mad
Trust in Jove and row with all we have
Coxswain, my dude, you gotta be our captain
Turn the ship away and don't let it happen
Hug that rock and we won't start cappin'
Or we'll be done for and our lives will be napkin

Oh my, Odysseus was quite the fighter
Ready to slay monsters, that couldn't be brighter
He listened to Circe, sure that was wise
But he broke one rule, which wasn't a surprise

"Put on your armor and grab a spear too
Tough times are coming, what will you do?"
With his men by his side, they braved the sea
Searching for Scylla, where could she be?

The men were nervous and he knew why
They didn't know what was lurking nigh
Odysseus stayed strong, ready for a fight
But Scylla was nowhere in his sight

He searched and strained, but no use
Until the monster appeared, ready to abuse
Odysseus and his men, what a sight to see
But he was ready, our hero, the Odyssey

Yo, we sailed into the Straits, fearing for our fate,
For on one side was Scylla, on the other, Charybdis' deadly trait.
The water bubbled and boiled like a cauldron so hot,
Spraying high on the rocks, screaming for us to stop.

As we watched the water spout and the whirlpool whirl,
Our minds became numb with terror, our hearts in a twirl.
Just as we thought it couldn't get any worse,
Scylla suddenly attacked with a devilish curse.

She snatched up my guys, the best men on board,
Their screams still echoing, their fate truly abhorred.
Like a fisherman spearing fish for a prize,
Scylla devoured my men before my very eyes.

It was the most sickening sight I'd seen in all my days,
This darkness before me, this never ending maze.
But I carried on, for I had to complete my quest,
Through all the obstacles, through everything that was best.

Yo, listen up, crew of mine,  
I got a prophecy, gonna drop some rhymes  
Teiresias warned me, I gotta be swift  
Stay away from Helios' island, and that's no myth  

The land of the sun god, sounds pretty fly  
But we're not welcome, and that's no lie  
I heard the cows mooing, the sheep bleating  
But we can't risk it, let's keep retreating  

Circe, she warned us, we gotta be smart  
Or Helios' wrath will tear us apart  
I know we're tired, I know we're spent  
But we gotta obey, this is not up for dissent  

So let's steer clear, let's not be fools  
Helios' island, ain't no place for us Jewels  
Our safety's top priority, that's the key  
Let's sail on, don't you agree?  

In meme-speak, I'll end this tale  
Stay woke, don't let the sun god impale  
Keep your head up, and your eyes peeled  
To the beach, let's not yield!

The crew was so tired they could hardly speak, 
Eurylochus, however, was acting like a freak. 
He said, "Ulysses, bro, you're being cruel,
You're strong as iron, and never tire, it's true. 

Your men, on the other hand, are worn out, 
They need to rest and get food, no doubt.
But you won't let them land and take a break,
Instead, you want them to sail and make a mistake. 

At night, the wind is strong and harmful too,
If we're unlucky, it'll wreck us too, 
Bro, let's have a meal here by the ship, 
Then tomorrow morning, we'll set sail with no slip."

Yo, all the guys agreed, Eurylochus spitting truth,
The gods out to get us, bringing mischief from the booth,
I know we outnumber you, but let's make a deal,
Don't mess with the livestock, let's chow down on the meal.

Heaven knows what danger we already face,
We don't need to anger the gods with our base,
Promise me you'll swear not to touch a single head,
Or we'll end up wishing we were already dead.

Circe's provided plenty so let's not get mad,
Trust me boys, it ain't worth making her dad,
If we all want to make it out of here alive,
Let's stick with what we have and strive.

Lit crew, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout a ship and a creature known as Scylla from hell.
Men swore an oath to keep their promise, no lie,
And they put their ship in a safe harbour nearby.

These sailors, they were tired and quite hungry too,
So they went to shore to cook a meal, that's what they'd do.
They ate and they drank, but then they started to speak,
Of comrades who were eaten by Scylla, so bleak.

The words were so sad, it made them all weep,
They cried so hard, they eventually fell asleep. 
This monster, it caused them such sad misery,
But now they rest, dreaming of victory.

Yo, it went down in the third watch of the night
The stars had shifted, everything was out of sight
Jove came through and brought a wild gale
The wind was so strong, it left no trail

Land and sea were covered with thick clouds
The darkness was too thick, it left no doubts
Out of the heavens, night sprang forth
It was like a scene from the North

But when Dawn, rosy-fingered, made an appearance
We found a cave, like a stroke of brilliance
Sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances there
We called the men together, ready to share

It was a council in a mystical place
The kind of vibes that can't be replaced
Just like the memes on the internet space
This story is now at a new pace.

I said to my squad, it's lit, we got food and drink in the ship, let's be legit and not touch the cattle on this trip. These cows and sheep belong to the almighty sun, who's always watching and listening to everyone. And they swore up and down, they would stick to the plan, Not trying to get left behind, stranded in this land.

Yo, for a month straight, the wind was whack
Only from the South and East, can you believe that?
The men stayed starvin', didn't touch the cows
Survivin' off hook and line, they weren't livin' like kings and queens, WOW
So, one day, I crept away from the bunch
Hoping the gods would show me a hunch
Found a spot, said my prayers, and lay my head to rest
Till I fell asleep and entered a sleepin' nest.

Yo, peeps, listen up to me,
We gotta act fast, can't you see?
There's nothun' worse than facing starvation,
So let's make an offering to avoid damnation.

Why not sacrifice the best of the cows,
To please the gods and take humble bows?
If we get back, we'll build a temple of high,
And make it grand with no limit to the sky.

But if Mister Sun wants to sink our ship,
And wants some revenge on this trippin' trip,
Then I rather drink salt water in despair,
Than starve in this island without any fare.

"Ay yo, y'all hear Eurylochus spittin' truth?
The boys agreed with him, no need to further proof.
Their cattle were chillin', no care in the world,
So they took the best and gave prayers to the gods unfurled.
No barley left, so they used oak-shoots instead,
Talkin' 'bout their feast, they gon' be well-fed.
They killed the cows and dressed their beef,
Wrapped the bones in fat, to be cooked by the reef.
No wine for drink-offerings, so they got crafty,
Kept pouring water, so their vibes wouldn't be ashy.
Grilled the meat, tasted it until it was gone,
Cut the rest up and put it on the spit, with a brawn." 

*mic drop* 🎤

Yo, woke up from my slumber, 
Smelled something that made me wonder, 
Hot roast meat, oh my gosh,
Prayed to the gods, feeling posh. 

"Immortal gods, how could you? 
Sending me to nap like a fool,
My loyal men are up to no good,
Off to the beach, they've misunderstood."

I marched towards the shore,
Saw my crew and I couldn't ignore,
The mess they made, oh dear,
My anger, they were about to bear.

But first, lemme take a selfie,
Post it to my Insta, feeling healthy,
Then it's time to lay down the law,
My crew better prepare for the raw.

Meanwhile, Lampetie didn't wait,
Hopped right up and flew to the sun, she's no bait,
Told him what we did to his cows with no hesitation,
And he went off, geez, what a situation!

The sun was boiling with anger and rage,
Said to the gods, "This time they've crossed the line, it's a new page,
Gotta get back at these Ulysses guys real quick,
Otherwise, I'll make sure they take a deathly dip."

He cried out to his peers up in the high,
"Father Jove, and all you other gods, hear my battle cry!
Ulysses' crew is about to face their worst fears,
Killing my cows, something that drives me to tears!"

He continued, "If they don't make this right,
I'm going down to Hades to shine my light,
Among the dead, they'll see my wrath,
Ulysses and his crew will feel my power, my path."

The sun was furious and filled with hate,
Ulysses needed to fix his mistake, the sun wouldn't wait,
He loved his cows with so much love and emotion,
Killing any more of them was definitely not an option.

Listen up, gods and all you fella-s, 
Jove's got a plan, a scheme so swella-s. 
He wants the sun to keep shining so bright,
But our poor seafarers are in for a fright.

With a bolt so white, lightning will strike,
Their ship will be shattered, what a dislike!
Jove's power on display will make them reel,
Into small pieces, their vessel he'll peel.

It's lit like a fire, a perfect plan,
Jove's got this in the palm of his hand.
Like that time when Drake was spittin' bars,
Jove is showing off his Godly stars.

Oh my gosh, let me tell you what's up,
Calypso spilled some tea, and it's super tough,
She said that Mercury's in the know,
And spilled some secrets that are worth the dough. 

I mean, can you even believe it,
Calypso heard it straight from the deity's lips, oh sh*t!
The gods are talking and we're not invited,
But thanks to Calypso, we're all feeling united. 

Mercury's the messenger, so he knows what's up,
And apparently, he's been dropping some pretty sick cuts,
Calypso's got the scoop and now we do too,
We're all in on the divine secrets crew. 

So let's take a sec to thank our girl Calypso,
For dropping some knowledge that's worth more than gold,
And now that we know what Mercury's been saying,
We'll be a step ahead and that's what I'm fraying!"

Yo, down by the shore of the sea
We saw some crazy signs and things to be
The cows were all dead, it was a massacre
I had to tell the crew, it was a disaster

I told them separately, but no one knew
What to do, we were in a huge moo moo
The Gods were surely not on our side
The hides of the cows crawled, we couldn't hide

The joints upon the spits began to low
Like cows, it was a really strange show
The meat kept making noises, raw or cooked
Like cows, it mooed, the whole crew was spooked

I don't know what's going on, can't deny
It's like a meme come to life, and it's no lie

Yo, listen up, hear my spiel
This story's wild, it's so real
Odysseus and his crew, they be chillin'
Grilling up cows, they do the grillin'

Jove was like, it's been six days
Time to stop with the beefy craze
They set sail, ready for the seas
But Zeus had other plans, oh please

A black cloud covered their ride
The sea turned dark, nowhere to hide
A squall hit hard from the West
Their mast snapped, it was a mess

The helmsman, he got hit so hard
His bones crushed, he fell overboard
No life left, a hero down
This adventure turned quite the frown. 

Bolt emojis to Zeus, he's the god
Who made this journey a little odd
Odysseus and his men, they must be brave
To survive this storm and this wild wave.

OMG, Jove's thunderbolts were wild,  
That ship was spinning like it was on a child's ride,  
Fire and brimstone, like my mixtape was lit,  
Lightning striking the ship, I can't get over it.  

The men fell into the sea like some seagulls,  
No chance of getting home, their situation was dreadful,  
Jove wasn't messing around, he had power like Thor,  
Those men had no hope, they couldn't ignore.

Yo, let me tell you a tale so epic,
About a sailor's adventure that's truly hectic.
He stuck with his ship despite the stormy weather,
Till the sea was too much and they lost it together.

The ship's keel drifted away from the hull,
Leaving him stranded and feeling quite dull.
The mast got knocked out into the abyss,
But wait, there's more, hear this.

A backstay of ox-thong was left hanging strong,
And with that, he lashed the mast like a pro all along.
Tied the keel and mast together for the ride,
And let the winds take him on the wildest ride.

It was like a scene straight out of a meme,
Floating away wherever the winds deemed.
But he took it all in like a boss,
And survived like a true sailor at loss.

Yo, the wind done changed, it's from the South again!
Which got me scared, I don't wanna be taken in
By Charybdis, that pool's a terrible scene!
And before I know it, I'm at Scylla's rock, getting keen.

The whirlpool's sucking water and I'm stuck in its hold,
But I cling tight like a bat to a fig tree, bold.
I can't plant my feet anywhere, my fate's been foretold,
But I hang on, patient, for the pool to unfold.

I wait so long, it's a drag like a court case in law,
But finally my raft escapes that whirlwind's jaw.
I fall heavily into the sea before it gets too raw,
And climb back onto my raft with a sigh of awe.

I grab the oars and begin to row with my hands,
But luckily Scylla didn't make any demands.
The gods saved me that day, without no reprimands,
And I live to tell this story to all my friends.

Yo yo my peeps, I gotta spill,
About how my life took a crazy thrill.
My journey was long, it took nine days,
Memes and slang came in handy in so many ways.

On the tenth night, the gods played their hand,
And hit me with a beach on this crazy land.
Ogygian Island was the name of this place,
Filled with gods and goddesses that I had to face.

But there was one, so powerful and strong,
Her name was Calypso, and she knew where I belonged.
She showed me kindness, and I gotta say,
It was better than any meme or internet display.

But listen, my friends, I've told this tale before,
And I don't wanna bore you or be a snore.
So let me end this in cool Gen-Z way,
Catch you on the flip side, have a lit day!

Hey there, my fam and squad, gather 'round
I've got a story that's sure to astound
It's got all the tea, it's spicy and hot
So buckle up tight, let's give it a shot

Once upon a time, in the digital space
There was a TikTok star with tons of grace
She danced and sang and made us all laugh
But then drama hit, and things got rough

Her ex-boyfriend, a gamer bro
Started a feud, just for show
He called her out, he spread some lies
But little did he know, she was wise

She clapped back, oh boy did she
She made a diss track, for all to see
And boy, it was fire, it was lit
She showed him up, and didn't quit

The internet cheered, they shouted and screamed
They shared her song, with all they deemed
Her fans went wild, they stan so hard
And as for the haters? They got barred

So now, this TikTok queen
Is living her best life, on the internet scene
She showed us courage, she showed us sass
And to that gamer bro? She said "bye, Felicia"  #micdrop #savage #queen

BOOK XIII

Hold up, did you hear what he said? 
His story has us all ahead. 
We're stuck in this cloister, 
On his words, fully engrossed-er. 

Alcinous began to speak, 
His voice so smooth and so sleek. 
We all sat there in silence, 
Eager to hear his tale with no violence. 

His story has us on the edge, 
We can't wait to see what's ahead. 
We're all just captivated, 
With every word that's narrated. 

The way he spins his tale is wild, 
It's like watching a meme go viral. 
We're on the edge of our seats, 
Anticipating each word he tweets. 

Alcinous, your story is lit, 
We're hanging on every bit. 
Keep it coming, don't stop now, 
Your audience is loving the wow!

Yo, Ulysses you made it through,
No more pain or misadventures for you.
Others, who come to my place to chill,
Listen up, I have a proposal to instill.

To you, who love to drink my finest wine,
And bask in the beauty of my bard that's divine,
Ulysses has already packed up his share,
But let's give him more to show that we care.

A large tripod and a cauldron for you, sir,
From each of us, this present we'll confer.
We'll split the cost and make it fair,
So everyone can show their love and care.

Yo, Alcinous, your hospitality's off the chain,
Thank you for the dinner, it was lit, no shame.
But now I'm eager to continue on my way,
I'm ready to leave at the break of day.

Your ship is dope, with everything safely stored,
It's chill that you wanna help me afford,
A trip home safe, you're a good dude,
And honorin' Jove, that's real gratitude.

But, I can't help but watch that sunset,
I gotta bounce, it's time to jet,
My legs are itching, my heart is too,
I gotta get going, it's what I gotta do. 

So, bless up, Alcinous, and your Phaecian crew,
I'll remember your kindness, forever true,
And if you ever find yourself in need,
Just tweet at me, I'll come with speed. #GoodVibesOnly

"Y'all, it's been real, peace out. Raise your cups up, send me off with a shout. My heart's desire fulfilled, got an escort and gifts. Hope I can use 'em well, no room for rifts. Pray my wife's chillin' with her squad, living in peace. And y'all back home, happy families increase. Blessings from above, good grace on your side. Keep negativity away, let love abide."

Alcinous and his squad all agreed,
That our hero should get what he needs.
A crew to take him on his trek,
So he could travel without a wreck.

The servant went and grabbed some booze,
So they could make a toast and choose,
To pray to Jove, the god on high,
And make sure our hero won't die.

They drank and prayed, then said goodbye,
And wished our hero clear blue skies.
With a nod and a wave, he set sail,
Thinking about his epic tale.

And as he rode the ocean waves,
He thought about the journey that he braved,
And he couldn't help but think it's true,
That this story is straight up lit like Pikachu!

Oh dang, Pontonous is slinging the wine,  
Pouring it up for everyone so fine.  
They all made an offering to the gods divine,  
Cheers to heaven, drinking that wine so fine.  

But Ulysses, he ain't done yet,  
He got a double cup, oh so lit.  
And hands it to the queen with much respect,  
She sips it back, no need to neglect.  

Arete's sipping that drink with ease,  
She knows what's up, she's queen of these.  
With Ulysses there, she's feeling that breeze,  
Sipping that drink just like it's a tease.  

So cheers to them, they know how to drink,  
Pouring them up, no need to think.  
They drink to the gods, they drink to their link,  
May they party forever, without even a blink.

Bye bye, queen, it's time to part ways,
Until old age comes and death pays,
I'll leave you now, so live in bliss,
In this house filled with kids and Alcinous.

Peace out, it's time for me to dip,
You've got your peeps and family to grip,
Stay happy in this cozy abode,
With kids and king to share the load.

I bid you adieu, my lady fair,
May your life always be full of flair,
Cherish your moments, every single one,
And keep on living, until your days are done.

As he be kickin' it, he crossed the threshold,
Alcinous sent a man to lead him to his ship and to the sea shore that's bold.
Arete also sent some maid servants with him,
One with a clean shirt and cloak, and another to carry his strong-box with some dim.
The third one brought corn and wine,
So he could have a good time and not whine.
When they got to the water side,
The crew took these things and put them on board with a sense of pride.
With all the meat and drink, they made sure it was tight,
So nothing would fall and cause a fright.
But for Ulysses, they laid a rug and a linen sheet,
So he could sleep well and not face defeat.
Then he too went on board and lay down without a word,
Whilst the crew took every man's place and loosed the hawser, like real nerds.
As they began rowing out to the sea,
Ulysses fell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike slumber in glee.

Yo, the ship was lit, making moves with no quit,
Riding waves fierce like a stallion's neck, so legit.
Ain't no falcon, no bird, no speed could keep track,
Of this vessel's pace, cutting through waves like a Mack.

Who's on board, you ask? A true hero in his time,
Cunning like the gods, surviving sea and battle's thine.
Now sleeping soundly, with a peace so deep,
Forgetting his struggles, finally laid to sleep. 

This ship, this hero, we stan them so much,
For they prove that resilience is always in touch.
We hype them up, give them the praise they deserve,
For they're the ones who inspire us to be tough.

So let's give a shoutout, a meme and a cheer,
For this ship, this hero, who we hold dear.
May they sail on, to more victories to their name,
And may their legacy forever remain. #LegendaryShip #SleepingHero #WaveRider

Yo, let me tell you 'bout a tale so dope,
Of a ship that sailed near a haven, no joke.
An old merman named Phorcys owned this crib,
Protected from wind and sea, what a clever bib.

The harbour was so bomb, not even moored,
A ship could stay there without feeling bored.
Standing tall was an olive tree,
Nearby, a cavern full of mystery.

Inside this spot, the nymphs got swag,
Mixing-bowls, wine-jars, and bees they had.
Great looms of stone created robes so neat,
Sea purple, it was a sight, hard to beat.

This cave had entrances two-fold,
Mortals could use one, but gods the other hold.
From the North and South, they could be found,
Through the latter entrance, gods were bound.

Yo, they brought the ship to shore,
Ulysses still asleep, snore by snore,
Lifted him up, laid him on sand,
Not a peep, he slept off that land.

Minerva helped him with some gifts,
Phaeacians were convinced to uplift,
Presents by the tree, hidden from the street,
Afterwards, they left with speedy feet.

No one could steal for Ulysses to take,
Once he opened his eyes, he'd be awake,
And then he'd have the best surprise,
Thanks to his friends, he'll be allies.

Yo daddy Jove, listen up please,
These mortals are making me weak in the knees,
The Phaeacians- my own blood, they boast,
But they disrespected me when Ulysses they brought as their host.

I promised to send him home, after enough pain,
Not to leave him stranded, or make his efforts in vain.
But now they've brought him home with gifts galore,
More than he'd have gotten in Troy, that's for sure.

If I let this slide, I'll lose my godly sway,
And my reputation will be washed away.
So what do we do to make things right?
Should we give them a fright, or spark a fight?

Oh my lord of the Earthquake, you speak of disrespect,
But the gods ain't that rude, they'd show you some respect.
It would be mad if deities dared to offend,
So don't you worry, they're loyal 'til the end.

But if it's mortals you're talking 'bout today,
And they're acting up in a disrespectful way,
Then it's all on you to figure out what to do,
Handle the situation, no need to feel blue.

You're the boss, you got this, don't need no cheerleading,
Just remember, you're mighty, there's no need for pleading.
So go forth and conquer, like a boss supreme,
Teach those mortals respect, make them dream your dream.

Yo, yo, yo, my dude is Neptune,
He's kinda salty, but trying to stay clean,
He don't wanna upset the king,
So he's hesitating, ain't doing a thing.

But hold up, hold up, he's got a plan,
To wreck that Phaecian ship, yo, that's the man,
He's saying it'll stop their escort game,
And bury their city under a mountain of fame.

That's a little extreme, you gotta admit,
But my guy Neptune, he just won't quit,
He's the god of the sea, he's got the power,
To lay waste to cities in less than an hour.

So let 'em know, Neptune's on the chase,
And if they come around, he'll wreck their place,
No escorts for them, no sir, no how,
Good luck Phaecians, y'all better bow.

"Yo, Zeus," replied I, "I'm down for your plan of surprise,
Turning that ship into a rock will be a dope disguise.
The city peeps will go wild, their reactions will be sicker,
And burying their town? That'll make them think you're the real bicker.

Let's do this like Nike, just do it and no need to wait,
We'll blow up Twitter feeds, we'll be the talk of the state.
They won't know what hit them, they'll be left shook and bamboozled,
Our plan will be so fire, they'll be left with opinions muzzled.

So let's get to it now, let's show them who's the boss,
We'll rock it like Ariana, showing them who's the sauce.
Our plan will be legendary, they'll be left with jaws on the floor,
We'll be the kings of the world, and they'll be left begging for more!"

Yo, Neptizzle came to play
When he heard the ship was on its way
He went to hang with the Phaecians
And waited for the ship with patience
When it arrived, he made a sly move
Turned it to stone, and made it groove
He pushed it down, oh so smooth
And then, he was off to groove!

Oh my days, did you see that ship?
It was as if it got stuck on a dip!
We looked away, just for a sec,
And it got rooted, what the heck?

I'm shook, fam, it's quite bizarre,
Who could've done it, near or far?
Our eyes were on it, every bit,
And now it's stuck, just like Brit.

Maybe Poseidon snatched it down,
And left it there for all around,
To see it rooted like a nail,
In the ground, or should I say, the sail.

But honestly, it's all a mystery,
This ship, it's stuck, can't you see?
Oh wait, I have a theory, my friends,
Perhaps it's magic, or some trend?

The Phaeacians were surely confused,
Their minds twisted and abused,
But one thing was certain, without a doubt,
Their ship's fate was sealed, no way out.

The Phaeacians were chill, always giving escorts with cheap thrills,
But Neptune wasn't lit, he had beef with their ships, and caused spills.
A curse on their city, buried under a high mountain,
But Alcinous had prophecy on his side, he was truly fountain.
No more escorts for them, no more trips with Phaeacians' aid,
And to Neptune they sacrificed twelve bulls so his wrath could fade.

Yo, the chiefs of the Phaecians were straight flexing,
Around King Neptune's altar with their offerings perplexing.
Then Ulysses woke up, back in his homeland,
But everything looked strange, like it was all planned.

Jove's daughter, Athena, made a foggy day,
So no one would know Ulysses was here to stay.
She wanted him to take revenge on the wicked suitors,
Without his wife or friends from recognizing his features.

The tracks, harbours, and trees all seemed strange,
As Ulysses started up and cried in despair, not quite in range.
He smote his thighs with the flat of his hands,
Worried about how his return would unfold amidst these new lands.

"Yo, this guy needs some savvy direction,
Is he with the savages or in civilized section?
He needs to stash his goods and plan his path
Or else some thief will definitely do the math.
He wishes to be with the Phaeacians in comfort,
Or with a nice chief who's not a grumpy wart.
The way his trip went was not even fair,
They didn't bring him home, like how dare.
May Jove the protector of suppliants hear his prayer,
And punish them for being so unaware.
Now he must check if his stuff is still there,
So no one can steal it, that's his biggest scare." 
#Savage #Blessed #Goals #Jupiter #Drama #FOMO #Lit #Hashtag.

Yo, Ulysses was straight trippin',
Counting coins and cauldrons, his heart skipping.
He had all the riches money could bring,
But still he longed for his own land's peaceful wing.

As he wandered by the sea in distress,
A young shepherd approached him with finesse.
Her cloak was fly, her feet in sandals so neat,
Ulysses' heart skipped a beat.

It was Minerva, the goddess so fly,
With a javelin in her hand that could touch the sky.
Ulysses was lit to see her in his presence,
They locked eyes, it was truly a blessing.

Oh, dude, I see you're lost and alone,
Don't worry, I'll help you find your way home,
Greetings and salutations, my dude,
I'll be your navigator, I'm in quite the good mood.

Protect your goods and keep you safe,
I'll do my best, there's no need to chafe,
You're asking 'bout the land and its folks,
And if it's an island or if it's on the coast.

Well, dude, you're in luck, 'cause I know,
I can show you the ropes and make your knowledge grow,
This country is dope, it's the land of the free,
With people of all kinds, from land to sea.

It's not just an island, no way, Jose,
It's connected to all, in a major way,
This place is cool, it's the best of the best,
So don't you worry, just sit back and rest.

Okay, listen up, stranger, you may seem kind of out of place
But let me fill you in, so you're not lost in space
This place is lit, and yeah, it's known both far and wide
Ithaca's where you're at, a place with a lot of pride

The land's pretty rocky, so driving's not that fun
But corn and wine? Boy, do we have a ton!
Rain and dew provide irrigation, water's not hard to find
Cattle and goats roam free, and all kinds of trees do bind

This place is the bomb dot com, water never runs dry
So it's no surprise, from Troy they'd know Ithaca on the fly
As Minerva said, this place is famous and grand
So, dear stranger, now just try to understand!

Yo, Ulysses just got home and he's feelin' fine,
But he spun a lie, and it wasn't benign,
Minerva called him out, she knew he was fakin',
Instinctive wiliness can be quite overtakin'.

He thought he was slick with his lying tale,
But Minerva knew his honesty was frail,
It's like that Drake meme, when he's saying "No,
But really he means "Yes", it's all just a show.

Ulysses tried to pull a fast one on us,
Thinking he could lie and we wouldn't fuss,
But we see right through him, no need to pretend,
Next time he'd better tell the truth, or it's the end.

Aye aye captain, you sound like a rapper,
Tell me your story homie, I won't be a napper.
You say you left Troy with lotsa' treasure,
But had to flee, it was quite a pressure.

You killed Orsilochus, the fastest runner,
And now you sprintin' like there's no other.
He accused you of not servin' his dad quite right,
So you killed him to make sure he wasn't right.

You sailed to escape, and asked Phoenicians for help,
To settle in Pylos or Elis, with your riches and wealth.
You gave them loot and they didn't mean any guile,
But the wind blew the ship, and it went off the Nile.

You landed in Ithaca, and were quite tired,
You lay down on the sand, a little uninspired.
The Phoenicians took your treasure and left you behind,
And now you're here, searching for something to find.

Dang, Minerva, you're looking fine,
Caressing Odysseus and being kind;
But let's talk real, this man's a beast,
Full of guile, cunning, a liar at least.

Odysseus, you sly dog, can't you drop your tricks?
Even though you've got a bunch of hicks?
But let's not dwell, we both can deceive,
You with your counsel, me with my subtlety, believe.

Of course, I'm Jove's daughter, the goddess Minerva,
With you through thick and thin, never an endeva'.
Remember how I helped the Phaeacians like you?
Now let me help hide your treasure, it's the least I could do.

But wait, there's more, troubles still to come,
In your own house, you gotta act like a mum,
Put up with everything, don't tell a soul,
Stay quiet, don't lose control.

Yo goddess, you always come through with the light,
But I can't keep up with all of your different sights.
Back in Troy, you were super kind to me,
But ever since then, you've been tough to see.

I'm lost and confused, can't tell where I'm at,
Feels like I'm stuck in some sort of trap.
Minerva, girl, tell me what's up,
Or am I just another one of your puppets?

I need to know the truth, don't play me like that,
My heart can't take it, don't you understand that?
Am I really home, in Ithaca once more,
Or is this some sort of twisted lore?

Yo, you always got something up in your dome,
But I won't leave you when you're feeling alone,
You're so slick with your words, a shifty boss,
I can't help but stick around, no matter the cost.

Most peeps would head straight home, family first,
But you don't seem to care, that's gotta hurt,
Your wife's at home, crying up a storm,
And you haven't asked about the fam since you were born.

I never worried 'bout you, thought you'd make it back okay,
Even though you lost your squad, Neptune had a price to pay,
But let me give you the tea, spill it all out clear,
This is the merman Phorcys' haven, olive tree right here.

The nymphs cave is nearby, let's not forget,
And you've been all over this mountain, no regrets,
So listen up, dude, I'm your trusty guide,
Let's do this together, side by side.

Oh snap, Ulysses back in his own turf,
After 20 years, he's finally off the surf.
He kissed the soil, feeling so blessed,
And prayed to nymphs like he was possessed.

"Yo, Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove,
I thought I won't see you again, but I hope
You'll grant me long life and happiness,
Plus, bring my son to manhood with finesse."

Ulysses sure knows how to show love,
He'll bring offerings, like a dove.
He hopes Athena, daughter of Zeus,
Will bless his journey and fill him with juice.

Yo, don't worry 'bout a thing,
We'll keep your stuff safe with this bling,
Let's stash it all up in the cave,
And ensure your valuables are saved.

Let's brainstorm how we can make it work,
Secure from thieves and any lurk,
Pack it tight like we're moving house,
We won't let your things go south.

Minerva's got this, fam, no doubt,
We'll keep your stuff from going out,
Our strategy will be top-notch,
No need to stress, we've got the watch.

So relax and take a seat,
Let us take care of this feat,
Your things will be in good hands,
Minerva's a queen with her plans.

Oh, bruh, let me tell you 'bout this king,
Ulysses, he's the dude who runs this thing.
He's got gold, bronze, and clothes so fresh,
The Phaecians gave 'em to him, oh yes!
But now he's hiding in a cave,
With Athena's help, he's gonna save
Himself and his kingdom, 'cause it's under attack,
By those suitors, yo, they gotta step back.

So they sat down by this giant tree,
Scheming how to make the suitors flee.
They'll come up with a plan so slick,
Like that meme where the cat plays with a stick.

Yo, Ulysses, listen up my man,
Those dudes in your house got a terrible plan,
They've been lording it up for years without you,
Your wife's been loyal, but they've been tryna woo.

She's been giving them hope and sending them love,
All the while thinking of you, like a dove,
They think they're slick, but they ain't got a clue,
Minerva's here to help, and she's got wisdom too.

Think of ways to lay hands on these fools,
And let them know you're no one's tool,
Strike swift and true like a deadly gun,
And make sure those suitors know they'll get none.

You got this, Ulysses, we all believe,
Now go and make those suitors grieve,
Remember, you're a hero, a legend of old,
Your story's about to get even more bold.

Oh, Ulysses, you sure have nerve,
Facing your struggles with a bit of verve,
Standing beside you, I'll help you out,
Like a boss lady, no room for doubt.

Your house may be full of strife and pain,
But with my advice, you'll surely gain,
Let's plot revenge, and crush the foe,
Together we'll make it a killer show.

Goddess at your side, you'll have the power,
To take on those who wronged you in their tower,
Think of the past, the Trojan War we won,
This battle will be over before it's begun.

Haters gonna hate, but we got each other's back,
No Zeus, no Poseidon, can make us slack,
We're the ultimate duo, like Batman and Robyn,
Bring on the challenge, 'cause we're just getting started.

No need to fear, for we're in this together,
With my help and courage, you'll fight like a feather,
So let's get this done, and show them who's the boss,
With our team work and brains, we'll toss them like moss.

Yo, listen up, this is dope, trust me, 
This plan will make those suitors flee. 
I'm gonna change your appearance, 
So that you're unrecognizable with coherence. 

We'll add mad wrinkles to your face, 
Your luscious locks will be out of place. 
A gross garment will be your attire, 
Guaranteed to make the suitors perspire. 

Your fine eyes will become blurry, 
Making you look like something out of a slurry. 
You'll be a sight for all to dread, 
Even to your wife, who you have wed. 

Go find the swineherd, he's a friend, 
With your beloved pigs, his time he'll spend. 
Check in on your kingdom and see, 
How the suitors are treating your property. 

As for me, I'm off to Sparta to check, 
On your son's life since you left the deck. 
When I come back we'll have a plan, 
To make the suitors scram. 

Stay low-key and keep it real, 
And soon those suitors will surely feel, 
The wrath and power of a true king, 
And the vengeance that he'll bring. 

*drops mic* #LitPlansForTheWin

Hold up, let me translate,
Ulysses asking why didn't you communicate?
You knew what was up, so why didn't you spill,
Did you want him to suffer, while you sit still?
Sailing through hardships, while others feast,
Not cool, man, not even in the least.

Oh my god, Minerva's spittin' truth,
Sending Telemachus on a journey, forsooth!
She wants him to get a good reputation,
And avoid any hurt or altercation.

He's kickin' it with Menelaus, quite chill,
With all provisions in hand, he doesn't feel ill.
But the suitors are fierce, and on his trail,
Hopin' he won't make it, so their plan won't fail.

Minerva's optimistic he'll be okay,
But those suitors should watch out, or they'll be gone away.
They're too busy eatin' up someone else's estate,
But they're in for a surprise, that's for damn sure, mate!

Oh snap, Minerva's really got that wand game!
She made him old, and wrinkled up his frame.
No more blonde locks, and his eyes went weak,
New clothes too, looking ragged and meek.

He used to look like a total hottie,
But now his appearance is pretty shoddy.
Minerva gave him a deer skin coat,
And a staff in case he gets stuck on a goat.

His wallet is rough, and full of holes,
But at least he's got something to hold.
No cash in sight, but he's still a boss,
Rockin' that grumpy-old-man vibe like a boss.

Oh snap, Telemachus is about to go on a ride,
With Athena by his side, he won't need to hide.
The goddess went straight to Lacedaemon, no lie,
To hype up Telemachus, like she's DJ Khaled saying "another one" before a new vibe.

Telemachus will soon learn 'bout his daddy's past,
With Athena as his guide, this adventure will last.
They'll fly through time like Marty and Doc,
Gonna need a flux capacitor to keep up with this flock.

But wait, who's that lurking in the shadows?
Is it a monster or just some foe in battle?
With Athena by his side, Telemachus will fight,
And defeat any enemy, with his epic might.

This story's lit, with drama and action,
Telemachus is gonna get the satisfaction,
Of finding out what his dad's been up to,
Thanks to Athena, the goddess with mad woo.

What's poppin' my homies, gather around!
I got a story that will leave you spellbound.
It's so lit, it'll make your head spin,
A tale to tell your squad, your kin.

Picture this: a wild adventure in the night,
A group of friends, full of delight.
They hop in a whip, ready to go,
Feeling themselves like a Kanye show.

They hit the town, cruising and vibing,
With Cardi B on, their swag was thriving.
They stop at a spot, lit like a candle,
Another level, it was pure scandal.

After a few drinks, they hit the dance floor,
Shimmy and shake, couldn't ask for more.
But little did they know, a plot was brewing,
The night took a turn, it was so confusing.

Suddenly the lights went out, complete darkness,
The music stopped too, it was heartless.
Then out of nowhere, a voice did appear,
"Solve this puzzle, or you'll shed a tear."

With only moments to think and react,
They knew they had to solve the task.
It was like the escape room, but way more intense,
Every second counted, not a moment to commence.

They worked together, phones out, typing fast,
Texting furiously, not a moment could they waste.
Solving each clue, one by one,
They were in it to win it, they couldn't come undone.

Finally, after what felt like hours,
They cracked the code, defeated the powers.
The lights came back on, cheers erupted,
They hugged and danced, their hearts interrupted.

So take a cue from this epic tale,
Gather your friends, set sail.
Explore the city, enjoy the ride,
And maybe, just maybe, you'll have a story to confide.

Now I gotta jet, catch you on the flip side,
Till then, peace out, stay fly, keep it live!

BOOK XIV

Ulysses took the rough road, quite a hike
To find the swineherd- his most thrifty tyke.
Minerva gave him the tip to seek 
The one who takes care of the pigs every week.

The swineherd sat in front of his place
Surrounded by yards and pigs with space.
He built it all himself without anyone knowing
With stones from the ground without even showing.

Thorn bushes fenced them from the rest of the land 
And all around, pigs had room to grandstand.
A strong oak fence was built with precision 
To keep the pigs safe without a single omission.

There were so many pigs it made Ulysses dizzy 
Instead of boars, suitors made them all a bit busy.
But, still, the swineherd had lots to give 
Always sending the best so the suitors would forgive.

Three-fifty boar pigs and four fierce hounds 
Making sure the pigs stay safe in their grounds.
Lastly, the swineherd was found cutting  
A pair of solid sandals, no ifs or butting.

Yo, when Ulysses approached the place
The barking hounds were in his face
But dude is smart, he sat right down
And let go of his wooden crown

The dogs were ready to cause some strife
But the swineherd saved him with his life
He threw some stones and made them flee
Then said, "old man, you're lucky to be

Alive and well, those dogs are mean
They could've ripped you, know what i mean?"
But he was in pain, for his master lost
Ulysses had to pay the cost

Now he's just a swineherd, serving pork
While his master is stranded with no fork
So come on in and have some bread
Tell me about you, where you fled

The swineherd said, "Bet, bro, you're too kind,
It's no problem, though, you're on my mind.
Take a seat on this bed of rushes and chill,
I got you a shaggy chamois skin, for real."
Ulysses then said, "I hope the gods bless
Your kindness and give you happiness.
Thank you for being so hospitable,
Your generosity is truly admirable."

Oh man, you speak truth, Eumaeus dude,
Strangers, beggars, they are all from Jove, no need to be rude.
Just take what you can get and be grateful, that's key,
'Cause young lords make servants live in fear, believe me.
You say your master would have done great things by ya,
But sadly, he's gone, and left you here to just survive, huh?
Helen's race seems to be pure evil,
Killing many a good man, they're certainly not peaceful.
So your master had to go fight the Trojans in Ilius town,
For kin Agamemnon, that's where glory was found.

A feast fit for the gods, that's what they had -
Roast pork and wine, quite a combo, mad!
The swineherd was kind, he picked the best,
Sacrificed the pigs, Ulysses was blessed.

Singed and spitted, the meat was so hot,
Barley meal seasoned, that hit the spot!
The swineherd, a boss, mixed up some wine,
Ivy-wood bowl, drinking time's divine.

"Dig in," he said to the hungry guest,
Ulysses was grateful, he felt so blessed.
The feast was lit, thanks to the swineherd guy,
A meal to remember, they both can't lie.

"Bro, grab a seat and munch on some pork,
The suitors take the best, like they're from New York.
But the gods don't dig this shameless behavior,
Respect is earned by those who do what's lawful and greater.

Even the fierce free-booters, they raid and they plunder,
But when they get home, they start to think and wonder.
They look for judgement, feeling conscience-stricken,
But these people, they waste Ulysses' estate; they be trippin'.

Some god must've told them that Ulysses is gone,
So they take what they want, like it's a marathon.
They don't make offers of marriage in the usual way,
They just take his wealth, like it's all just child's play.

Every day, they sacrifice a ton of wine,
They party hard, like it’s summertime.
Ulysses was rich, like twenty men combined,
The wealth he had, was just out of our mind.

He had twelve herds of cattle on the mainland,
And as many flocks of sheep, that led the band.
Twelve droves of pigs, and twelve wide-spreading herds of goats,
It's no wonder the suitors are hitting all the high notes.

Here in Ithaca, he had large flocks of goats,
And these suitors get his best like they're on remote.
As for me, I look after these pigs you see,
And send the best ones every day, like one, two, three."

Yo, Ulysses was straight up savage,
Eatin' and drinkin' like it was cabbage,
All while scheming for his ruthless desire,
His anger growing hotter than a fire.

The swineherd filled his cup with vino,
Ulysses was grateful, he didn't say no,
But curiosity sparked in his gaze,
As he asked about his owner, in a haze.

"Who was this dude, so rich and bold?
Whose life was taken, never to grow old?
Did I cross his path on my crazy trips?
I can't remember, my memory slips."

The gods may know, but Ulysses too,
Travelled far and wide, his story's true,
So he may have heard news of the master,
And with that, his revenge could come faster.

It's like that Drake meme, started from the bottom,
Now he's on a mission, can't nobody stop him,
Ulysses is destined for greatness,
His story will leave all others in shambles, for goodness sakes!

Yo, old man, your tale sounds fake,
I don't believe a single word you make,
Strangers come here with their lies,
Thinking they can fool us with their disguise.

My mistress Penelope has heard it all,
Every traveler who comes to our hall,
But they're all phonies with no real proof,
Just trying to score a meal and a roof.

And you, with your shirt and cloak so neat,
I bet you're just looking for something to eat,
You say Ulysses is lost at sea,
But I think that's just a fantasy.

Wolves and birds may have eaten his bones,
But his memory in my heart still hones,
I miss him dearly, he was more than a boss,
A loyal friend who never came across as a loss.

Yo listen up, let me tell you a tale
Of Ulysses, a legend who's not for sale
His friend was doubtful, didn't believe he'd return
But Ulysses swore by king Jove, he'd make the others burn

With his words so bold, he took an oath
By the hearth of his home, he'd bring forth his troth
No need to pay, he just wanted to wait
Till the man arrived, then he'd accept his fate

Ulysses was coming, that's what he said
Gonna rain down vengeance, on all those who'd misled
In this very year, he'd be back with his might
And all those who'd wronged him, would face a fight

So let's wait and watch, for the hero's return
And hope that he'll teach us, the things we all yearn
Of resilience and strength, in the toughest of times
This is the story that we'll tell for all times

Hey, Eumaeus, you old swineherd dude,
I ain't gonna lie, I'm in a bad mood.
Ulysses ain't comin' back, that's a fact,
So let's drop the subject, that's my tact.

I ain't dissin' your oath, that's for sure,
But hearin' 'bout Ulysses hurts me to the core.
Penelope and Telemachus pray for his return,
But it ain't happening, no matter how hard we yearn.

And don't even get me started on Telemachus, man,
He was gonna be like his dad, handsome and tanned.
But something's messed up his head,
Now he's gone to Pylos to search for the undead.

Those suitors in Ithaca are layin' in wait,
Hopin' to leave Telemachus with a bad fate.
But enough 'bout him, let's talk 'bout you,
Where you from? What's your story? I wanna pursue.

How did you get to Ithaca, all alone?
What's your hometown, throw me a bone.
What kinda ship brought you, where'd it dock?
Spill the tea, let's hear you talk.

Yo, Ulysses, spill the tea
Let's hear all about your misery
If food and booze were in our reach
I'd talk for a year without a speech
My story's full of sorrow and pain
But I promise it's not all in vain
The gods have played me like a toy
And messed with me like a bored schoolboy
But don't worry, I won't bore ya
I'll tell it all, like it's Regina George on Mean Girls, oh yeah!

Yo, listen up, let me tell you 'bout my life,
I'm a Cretan, born to a slave, gave me strife,
My dad, Castor, was the man, the hero,
Rich, brave, his lineage far from zero.

I was given a little when he's long gone,
My bros split his wealth, but I'll carry on,
My strength and courage helped me snag a wife,
No need to brag, I don't fear for my life.

In battle, I'm a beast, full of might,
No enemy too strong, they're in my sight,
Farms and kids aren't my thing, you see,
Seafaring and fights are where I feel free.

Before Troy, I led men and ships with pride,
Nine times in command, wealth on the side,
I got the richest spoils, that's the way,
Now you know what's up with me, okay?

Bruh, let me tell you 'bout my life,
I got famous in Crete, no strife.
Then the people told me to go,
To fight in Troy, it was a show.

It took us nine years to take that town,
We battled on, our faces in a frown.
But eventually, we saw success,
And sailed away, our mission to bless.

But then, it seemed like my luck turned,
Jupiter, my fate, he spurned.
I decided to set my sights on Egypt,
Fitted out a fleet, that was my habit.

I had nine ships by my side,
My crew was pumped, we'd take a ride.
We feasted for six whole days,
But then we left, set sail in many ways.

For five days, we sailed so right,
A fair wind behind us, out of sight.
We reached the river, full of hope,
And sent men out to help us cope.

They scouted the land, looked for signs,
We left our ships in safe confines.
But troubles came, not gonna lie,
And we had to fight to stay alive.

Oh my gosh, this story's wild,
It's got drama that's stacked by a mile.
You had your men, your orders,
But they didn't listen, they thought they were bolder.

They took their own path and showed no restraint,
And left destruction in their wake, with lives as the cost they paid.
You regret your choices and wish to be dead,
The sorrow you'd face is still up ahead.

But then you came up with a plan so bizarre,
To go up to the king and put on a façade.
You grasped at his knees, and he let you live,
His kindness you'll remember and to Jove, you'll give.

Those who tried to hurt you were stopped in their rage,
For the king knew that Jove is totally not a fake.
He protects visitors and strangers alike,
Punishing those who do evil, that's his strike.

This story's lit, a real adventure,
It's got everything from start to departure.
Memes and slangs may come and go,
But cool stories like this will remain like whoa!

Yo, I lived with the Egyptians for seven years,
Got mad money from them, brought no tears.
Then came a Phoenician, a real sly dude,
Convinced me to go with him, his house to include.

Stayed for a year, but then it was time to jump,
When he set me on a ship, my heart did thump.
He said we were bound for Libya with cargo to bear,
But I knew deep down, it was a trap, unfair.

His intention was to sell me, and make a quick buck,
But I went along, hoping things won't suck.
Soon enough, we reached the land of Libya,
I'd have to start anew, with no Africa.

That Phoenician, he was a real villain,
But I saw it too late, my heart felt chillin'.
Now I'm in Libya, without a clue,
Wondering what my future will ensue. #LifeLessons #SlaverySucks #GreeceToLibya

Bruh, let me tell ya the tale
Of a ship caught in a fierce gale
Sailing 'tween Crete and Libya's sea
Thinking they'd make it out scot-free

But Jove, that god of thunderbolt power
Sent a black cloud down to devour
The ship with brimstone and flames
As lightning struck without any aims

The men fell like sea-gulls into the deep
Their fate, one that they couldn't keep
But as for the hero of our story
He clung to a mast, full of glory

Drifting for nine days without end
Until on the tenth night, dear friend
A wave brought him to the Thesprotian shore
Where he felt like he couldn't take no more

But then Pheidon, king of the land
Extended a gracious, helping hand
Hospitably entertained our hero, sans charge
And gave him clothes to replace his old, worn-out barge. 

TL;DR - A ship got wrecked thanks to Jove's thunderbolt power, but the hero survived by clinging to a mast and floated to Thesprotian coast where he received hospitable treatment from the king.

Hold up, wait a minute, let me tell you a tale,
Of Ulysses, a legend who went through a treacherous trail.
The king welcomed him with open arms,
Showing him treasures that can make you swoon with their charms.

Gold and iron in heaps and tons,
Enough to provide for not one, but ten generations.
Ulysses sought Jove's guidance in Dodona he went,
To know if his return to Ithaca should be real or just pretend.

The king swore by the gods and made a toast,
That a ship has been prepared, no need to boast.
Before Ulysses returned, he sent me away,
On a Thesprotian ship headed to Dulichium's bay.

The charge was to take me safely to King Acastus' estate,
So I bid farewell to the king and accepted my fate.
Ulysses' journey was far from done, but with hospitality so great,
He must have many stories and adventures to relate.

Okay, okay, okay, listen up y'all
Let me tell you a tale so wild
This dude got caught up in a plan
A scheme so rotten and so grand

The plan was to sell him as a slave
To send him off with nothing but rags to save
They took his clothes, he was left in despair
And then they sailed without a care

But the gods wouldn't let him go down
So they freed him and he didn't drown
He swam to land and hid in a wood
Until he found a good man who understood

Now, he's still alive and kicking
This story is simply so thrilling
From being sold out on the open sea
To finding a way to still be free

Like that Drake meme, what a journey 
From the depths of despair to recovery
With every challenge, he kept on fighting
And never gave up, kept on surviving.

Dang, Eumaeus, that story's wild,
But parts of it sound too mild.
I can't believe your Ulysses tale,
It sounds fishy like a whale.

Why would a man like you lie?
I can't let that pass me by.
I know all about your master's fate,
The gods made him meet a gruesome, terrible date.

They detest him, don't you know?
That's why they made him suffer so.
He should have died with honors high,
But now his fate's up in the sky.

The storm winds came and took him away,
Nobody knows where he went to stay.
So don't spin me those fairy tales,
Or I'll be calling you out for sales.

Yo, I gotta say
This old man is far away
With pigs he resides
Town visits only when Penelope decides

They ask him questions galore
Some grieve, and some want more
To eat up the king's property
Without paying, acting quite haughty

Once he was kind to a man
Who had come a long way from Cretan land
Said he saw Ulysses there
Refitting his ships without a care

He'd come back the next summer or fall
With much wealth for one and all
But now fate has brought this man to his door
Kindness will come out of respect for Jove, nothing more

Ay, ay, Ulysses, you're quite the pro,
But your word I take with a grain of dough,
A cloak and shirt for you, if your story's true,
But if not, we'll toss you from that steep preview.

The gods above will be our witnesses,
As we make this deal, minus the business,
Of hashtags, "yo's" and all that noise,
Just a simple oath, for grown-up boys.

If your master returns as you foretell,
You'll be clothed and sent off pell-mell,
But if not, oh tramp of little thought,
We'll give you a warning, with a most lethal toss.

So, Ulysses, let's make this deal,
In all honesty, let's make it real,
For the internet's watching, we must not fail,
To be true to our word, or we'll be in travail.

Eumaeus, my man, you're so hospitable
I'm feeling grateful, don't be doubtful
It's supper time, I'm feeling fine
Let's cook something savory, divinely divine

But hold up, my dude, let's talk about trust
If I killed you, it'd be pretty unjust
I won't do that, I'll keep it real
My morals are strong, I never steal

Let's be lit, let's eat and chat
About life, love and stuff like that
I'm grateful for this shelter you've shared
You're the real MVP, don't be scared

Yo Eumaeus, hear me out,
Let's sacrifice that pig, no doubt,
But make sure it's the best in the land,
So we can party and take a stand.

Toll of him ourselves we will,
Cause we've worked hard and it's time to chill,
These pigs have caused us so much strife,
Let's make a sacrifice and enjoy life.

Bring on the squealing and grunting sounds,
As we lock them up in their sties and grounds,
But let's not forget the chosen one,
The pig we'll sacrifice to have some fun.

We'll feast and hang out like the cool kids do,
Celebrating with drinks and BBQ,
With memes and slang we'll make it lit,
Cause that's how we celebrate, every bit.

So let's go ahead and get things started,
The best pig in the land, selected and becarded,
We'll make this a night to remember,
With swineherds and pigs, a party we'll render.

Yo listen up, let me tell you a tale,
About Eumaeus, a man that would never fail.
He was chopping wood when a pig arrived,
And they knew with a feast they'd soon be revived.

Before cooking, Eumaeus paid his respects,
Cutting bristles off the pig, it's what he expects.
He prayed to all the gods for Ulysses' return,
His morals and principles, something we should learn.

After striking the pig with a billet of oak,
They singed it and cut it, which wasn't a joke.
Eumaeus put some fat and barley on the coals,
Roasting the meat till it was good for our goals.

When it was ready, he made seven portions,
One for Mercury and the nymphs, no distortions.
The others he gave to each man, one by one,
Honouring Ulysses, his kindness never undone.

Ulysses was grateful for the meat he received,
Eumaeus' kindness, something he believed.
He hoped that Jove would also be kind,
To Eumaeus, a man of true peace of mind. 

#lit #respect #hype #feast #gods #grateful #outcast #kindness #morals #principles

Yo, my homie Eumaeus, 
Chow down and get full with us
God hands out blessings and takes away,
‘Cause he’s the boss, it's clear as day.

But enough of that preachy spiel,
Take another bite of your meal,
Enjoy it like its finest feast,
And let your taste buds have a feast.

Life is short, we gotta take what we get,
So embrace the good moments, don’t fret.
God's got a plan, it may be mystifying,
But trust in the process, it's satisfying.

So let's eat, drink, and be merry,
For tomorrow there may be no sherry.
God's got our back, we’ll be just fine,
As long as we enjoy this fleeting time.

The swineherd offered food to the gods in the sky,
And then passed the cup to Ulysses, oh my!
He chowed down on the food, all fluffy and nice,
And then went to bed, with his friends by his side.

This guy Mesaulius, what a true homie,
Bought bread for them all, not even a crony,
Without telling the mistress or his dad,
That's trust and loyalty that would make anyone glad.

They ate and they drank 'till their bellies were full,
And then hit the hay, no more food to pull.
Night had fallen, the moon shone bright,
Time to catch some Zs, and rest for the night.

Aye, it's stormin' and it's dark  
But Ulysses is still on a lark  
He wanted to see if he'd get lucky  
And Eumaeus would give him a cloak that's fluffy  

"Yo, listen up," he said with glee  
"I've got somethin' to tell, you'll see  
It's the wine talkin', so don't ya fret  
It makes me sing, dance, and chirp like a pet"  

Back in the day, Ulysses did lead  
In Troy, they planted an ambush seed  
Beneath the brush, they did reside  
Took cover from the cold and the snow that did slide  

The others had cloaks and shirts to wear  
And slept with their shields, without a care  
But Ulysses, oh he had forgot  
Left without his cloak, sittin' in a cold spot  

Two-thirds of the night had gone past  
Stars movin', the cold wind's blast  
Ulysses nudged with an elbow touch  
And whispered in his ear, it wasn't much

'Oh no, that's such a bummer dude, your frosty situation is really rude. Zeus played you like a fool and left you in the frigid pool. Fear not, bro, for I have a plan, we'll make some clothes with our own hands. We'll find some leaves and cover you up, like nature's own designer clothes, yup!' #SurvivalSkills #MythologyMemes #WinterWoes

"Aye aye, that's what I'm talking about, Ulysses was no mere peasant, he's the OG of mythological legend! With his brain that was as sharp as a sword, he came up with a plan that really soared. He was like Drake, started from the bottom, now he's here - outsmarting the gods without a single tear. Ulysses knew what's up, he wasn't a fool, his plan was so sly, it's like he went to Slytherin school. He was the king of the Trojan Horse, his cunningness could cause a divorce. This plan was his bread and butter, kinda like that meme with bread cat that everyone loves to utter."

"Stop moving, bro," he whispered down low. "Or you'll give us away, you know?" He propped himself up on one elbow. 

("Bro" can be used in place of "yo" sometimes!)

Yo, my dudes, listen to me
Last night I had a dream quite trippy
We're far from the ships, can't you see?
We need more men, like, pretty quickly

I wish someone could go down
And tell Agamemnon to send 'em on up
Or else we'll be left to drown
And end up empty as a Starbucks cup

We gotta get our squad in check
And fight like we're in a battle royale
With our swords and spears to protect
And win this war like we're epic and hella frail

So let's roll out like Optimus Prime
And show those Trojans what we're made of
And when we're done, we'll raise the roof, it's time
To celebrate and eat some Chick-fil-A, much love!

Oh snap, back in the day
Tholas ran like Usain Bolt, no delay
Left his cloak for the taking
I snatched it up, and my heart was breaking

Wish I could turn back time
When I was still in my prime
Nowadays, I'm treated like trash
'Cause my clothes got holes and rips and nasty rash

If only these swineherds knew
All the battles I've fought and been through
Maybe they'd show some respect
And give me a new outfit, direct

But no, they just judge and stare
Like they're better with their fancy wear
I'll keep on moving, though, no doubt
Even if I gotta go without.

Yo, old man, your story is sick,
It's been awesome hearing it,
You won't need clothes or anything more,
We'll give you what we can for sure.

But tomorrow, you'll have to wear,
Your old rags, it's only fair,
We don't have spare cloaks or shirts,
But we're not treating you like dirt.

When Ulysses' son returns from his trip,
He'll give you a new cloak and send you on your skip,
Wherever you need to go,
He'll hook you up, bro.

So don't worry, my man,
We've got you, we'll help you any way we can,
Just sit back and relax for the night,
We'll take care of you until we see some light.

Check it, Eumaeus ain't sleazy,
He hooked up Ulysses with a bed so cozy,
Threw down some skins on the ground,
And made sure he was warm and sound.

He covered him up with a heavy cloak,
In case the weather made him choke,
That's how you treat a guest, my dude,
Eumaeus knows what's good, it ain't rude.

Goatskins and sheepskins all around,
Making Ulysses feel like he's crowned,
And Eumaeus with the assist,
Giving Ulysses some sweet bliss.

It's all about hospitality,
Eumaeus got it, it's his reality,
Now Ulysses can rest with ease,
Thanks to Eumaeus, the goat with the keys.

Ulysses slept peaceful, getting some rest
With young men by his side, feeling blessed
But the swineherd wasn't one to snooze
Needed to check on pigs, that's his muse

He grabbed his sword and wore a thick cloak
Protecting himself from wind, it's no joke
Taking a goat's skin and javelin too
He's prepared for danger, that's his cue

Off he went to where the pigs lay
Under a rock, sheltered from the wind's sway
Making sure his property was all alright
Being a good steward, day and night.

Sup, sup, sup, let me tell you 'bout a story 
It's gonna make you LOL, it's gonna be so glory 
It's got memes up the wazoo, it's got all the feels 
You'll be ROFLing so hard, you won't need no meals 

There once was a dude, his name was Chad 
He was flexin' on the beach, he was looking mad 
But then came a wave, it knocked him down 
He was washed up on shore, he almost drowned 

But that's not the end, oh no, not even close 
'Cause then came a shark, and you know how that goes 
Chad was terrified, he thought he was done 
But then something crazy happened, it was like a pun 

A dolphin swam by, and it saved Chad's life 
He rode on its back, he was feeling so alive 
Now Chad's a changed man, he's got heart and soul 
He's telling everyone he knows, no more being a troll 

So next time you're feeling down, just remember this tale 
If a dolphin can save a Chad, then you can definitely prevail 
Stay lit, stay lit, don't let the haters get you down 
You're a boss, you're a king, wear that crown!

BOOK XV

Aye, Telemachus, it's time to bounce,
Your dad needs you, no time to lounge.
Minerva's the name, the goddess of war,
Here to tell you what you've been waiting for.

Your pops, Ulysses, needs your aid,
This journey of yours cannot be delayed.
Menelaus can help you on your quest,
But time is ticking, you gotta be the best.

Don't worry though, Minerva's got your back,
Like a boss, she's always on the attack.
You'll find your dad, it's gonna be dope,
But for now, let's bounce, no time to mope.

Yo Telemachus, it's time to bounce from this scene,
Don't let those suitors think they're king of the bean.
Your crib is gettin' eaten up and your mom's in distress,
Ask Menelaus to send you home, don't take no less.

Your lady's fam is tryna make her wed Eurymachus,
He thinks he's hot stuff, but he's really just frivolous.
Make sure nothing's taken from your crib, it ain't cool,
These chicks only think of themselves, they won't play you for a fool.

Head home and put your stuff in charge,
Of a lady who's legit, no need to be at large.
Be careful though, those suitors wanna take you down,
Sail night and day and your ship will hit no ground.

The god above will guide your way,
Those haters won't take you down, no way, no day.
Once you get home, holla at the swineherd,
He's got your back, no need for a watchword.

Stay for the night and then let Penelope know,
That you're not dead, you made it home, you're not feeling low.

Yo Pisistratus wake up from your nap,
Get the horses ready for a sweet sweet lap,
We gotta head home, it's time to depart,
And leave Olympus with a heavy heart.

Telemachus knows we gotta move soon,
Before the daylight fades into the moon,
Our journey continues and we mustn't stop,
Till we reach our home sweet home crop top.

So let's yoke those horses and get on the way,
Before the gods decide to make us stay,
Our story ends here but the adventure starts,
Setting off like lightning bolts, with our chariot and carts.

Dude, Pisistratus needs to chill,
Driving in the dark is bound to kill.
Gotta wait for Menelaus to come through,
And show some love, that's what we gotta do.

Being a guest is not just a vibe,
It's a bond you have to rightly describe.
Hospitality is key, it's not a game,
Menelaus deserves recognition, it's not lame.

Presents in the chariot, that's pretty neat,
Just like that meme of the cat who can't be beat.
And saying goodbye, it's a must,
It's the proper thing to do, no need to fuss.

Oh snap, Menelaus is in the mix,
Telemachus puts on his fit,
Throwing a cloak over his back,
He heads out to meet him, no time to slack.

"Menelaus, my man," Telemachus said,
"I need to head home, no time for bed."
I've been searching for my dad,
And though your hospitality has been rad,
It's time for me to hit the road again,
Before the journey drives me insane, you savvy friend?

Menelaus nodded, understanding with ease,
"I'll give you gifts, to appease,"
For though he didn't want to see him go,
He knew in his heart, it was time to let him flow.

From the ground, Menelaus took his leave,
Bestowing gifts that Telemachus would keep,
A silver mixing bowl, and a two-handled cup,
Worth more than a few bucks, level up!

"Safe travels, young buck, take care,"
Menelaus said, with a handshake to bear,
With that, Telemachus was on his way,
Back to Ithaca, hoping for a brighter day.

Aye Telemachus, if you truly wanna go,
I'll not hold you back, that much I know.
A grateful host shouldn't be too clingy,
Or too quick to say goodbye, that's just dingy.
We gotta be moderate, that's the key,
Letting guests stay or go, that's the way to be.
But before you leave, let me show,
The beautiful presents, I want you to know.
Let the women prepare a dinner just right,
Before you go out and take flight.
And if you have a whim to explore and roam,
I'll drive you myself, with my horses and chrome.
No one will let us leave with empty hands,
Bronze tripods, mules or even gold cups is what stands.

Yo Telemachus, I feel you, I ain't gonna front,
You gotta protect your property, that's what you want,
But listen, fam, you gotta chill and take a breath,
You can't just bounce right now, you might find your dad's address.

I know it's scary, thinkin' bout your valuables alone,
But you gotta trust the world, you gotta roam,
Your pops is out there, you gotta find him soon,
Just focus on that, and you'll return to your property like a harpoon.

Don't worry 'bout the rumors, don't worry 'bout the theft,
We got your back, we'll protect your bereft,
So let's go on this journey, find your father with pride,
And when we return, your property will be waiting with bated tide.

Yo Menelaus, he was chillin' at home
When he heard a story that made him all alone
He called his wife, said "Girl, dinner's on
Go cook some meat, let's make it a feast, let's get it done"

Then Eteoneus dropped by and helped with the fire
They cooked some meat, they got it all wired
While Menelaus and Helen, they went downstairs
To get some stuff, some treasures to share

Menelaus grabbed a cup, oh so fine
And told his son to bring a mixing-bowl in no time
Helen picked a dress straight from her chest
It shone like a star, it had to be the best

They walked back to Telemachus, all smiles
Menelaus wished him safe travels with style
He gifted him with his most precious belonging
A silver mixing-bowl that had everyone longing

Phaedimus was the king who gave it to Menelaus
On his way back from a journey, that was a plus
Now Telemachus got it, and it was all good
A present from Menelaus, an act of brotherhood.

Yo, what's up my lit squad,
Let me tell you 'bout a dope Greek god.
Telemachus was his name,
And his drink game was never lame.

His hands held a double cup,
And you know for sure it's lit, yup.
Megapenthes brought a fresh bowl,
Looking hot, straight outta control.

But hold up, miss Helen on the scene,
Got a robe ready, you know she's queen.
A beauty that can steal the show,
Looking fresh, head to toe.

So listen up, 'cause this tale's amazing,
Telemachus and crew, they're truly blazing.
Greek gods may be old school,
But their party game was incredibly cool.

"Yo yo, my dude," she said with glee,
"I got something here, just for thee.
A gift from Helen, oh so rare,
For your bride to wear, if you dare.
Keep it safe, don't let it stray,
Till the big wedding day.

Oh man, this trinket is legit,
Perfect for your bride to outfit.
Just give it to your mom to keep,
On your way home, you can sleep.
Back to your land, full of glee,
This gift from Helen will guarantee."

Yo, let me tell you 'bout a tale, it's straight from ancient Greece,
It involves Menelaus, Telemachus, and some feasts.

Pisistratus and Telemachus pulled up in a chariot,
Menelaus welcomed them and gave them gifts, no bullsh*t.
A golden ewer and silver basin for their hands,
The feast was lavish, they had everything grand.

The servants brought them bread and carved the meat,
Megapenthes poured the wine, it was so sweet.
They ate and drank till they could have no more,
Then Telemachus and Pisistratus headed for the door.

Menelaus came after them, with a golden goblet in sight,
He gave a drink-offering, wished them a safe flight.
"Farewell, my dudes! Tell Nestor how I treated you right,
Like a caring father, shining oh so bright!"

Oh dang, Telema-slayin' with the gifts today,
Gonna make Ulysses' heart say "yay".
We'll spill the tea to him, don't you fret,
All the kindness we've met from the folks we've met.

When we get back to Ithaca town,
We'll tell him of the gifts he's gonna crown.
This journey's been lit, with your generosity,
We'll share your deeds with the utmost sincerity.

Oh snap, y'all! Did you see that bird?
An eagle with a white goose, it's so absurd!
Everyone's running, shouting, and going berserk,
But hold up, wait a minute, let me get to the work.

Pisistratus, my dude, he asks the real question,
Was this omen for us or for you? It's like an intervention!
Menelaus, you gotta tell us what it means,
Is it good or bad, or is it something in between?

I'm not one to speculate, but I have a hunch,
This omen might mean something, it's not just a punch.
Up high in the sky, the bird flew so fast,
It's like the internet, it moves quick, it lasts.

So, let's take this as a sign and have some hope,
Maybe everything will be alright and we'll be able to cope.
For now, let's enjoy this moment and let our hearts take comfort,
As we move forward, we won't let this omen distort.

Oh snap, did you hear what Helen said?
She spilled tea and left everyone shook in bed.
She talked about Ulysses and his revenge plan,
And how he might already be back, quite the man.

She compared him to an eagle from its nest,
And said he's been through trials, and oh the quest.
She's reading this matter from her heart,
And trust me, she's one smart work of art.

Ulysses better watch out for the suitors,
They're in for a surprise, a little computer rebooter.
Helen's prediction will come to pass,
And when it does, it'll be a grand slam, no sass. 

So Menelaus, don't think too much,
Trust in Helen and keep in touch.
We don't want you to miss the fun,
When Ulysses delivers his revenge run.

Oh dang, Telemachus with the plans
Vowing to Athena like she's in high demand
Saying "May Jove so grant it" like he's in the know
Pledging to make vows to her like she's his main bro

Telemachus knows what's up like a boss
Talking to Athena like they're hangin' at the Cross
If it's really her, he'll give her thanks like a hero
And make promises to her like she's #1 at ground zero.

"Yo, these horses are so beast,
not to mention the speed, in the streets.
We cruised through the town like kings,
with everyone staring and doing wild things.

Pherae was our next stop for the night,
Diocles treated us right, no fright.
When rosy-fingered Dawn came to play,
we got back in the chariot and made our way.

Through the gateway we passed with ease,
our horses felt the breeze, no need to please.
Pisistratus was in control, no time to stall,
to Pylos we went, Telemachus said it all."

Oh dude, Pisistratus, you gotta make a vow, 
Our dads were friends, you know that right now, 
We're the same age, this journey brings us near, 
Don't take me past my ship, my man, my dear. 

I can't go to your dad's house, tryna chill, 
He'll make me stay, I need to leave, for real. 
I gotta head home, don't wanna be late, 
Promise me, Pisistratus, it's not up for debate. 

Don't get me wrong, your dad is really cool, 
But I've got things to do, I'm not some fool. 
I need to catch my ship, it's time to go, 
Make me this promise, it's gotta be a bro-to-bro. 

I hope you'll get me, and understand, 
I'm not trying to diss your father, I'm just trying to plan. 
So, make the promise, and let's be on our way, 
Thanks, dude, you're a real homie, okay?

Aye, Pisistratus, you got the plan,
Gotta put them gifts in that stern, can you understand?
Hop on board, tell your crew too,
Before your papa comes, all mad and blue.

I know the old man and his toughness,
He'll come for sure, but you gotta be ruthless.
He won't go back if you're not there,
So go, go, go, without a care.

But bro, he'll be angrier than Kanye,
When he comes and sees you sailin' away.
Just focus on the task at hand,
And leave the rest to fate's sweet strand.

Oh snap, Telemachus is in charge
He's leading the men, they're living large
They gotta get on the ship and leave this land
And head back home, they've got a plan

The Pylians were cool, but it's time to go
Telemachus said it, so it's a go
They gotta get everything in order, make it neat
And set sail home, it'll be a treat

But hold up, there's more, he's not done yet
Telemachus has orders, don't forget
He's gotta lead the way, gotta be the boss
And get his crew home, without a loss

So let's get it, team, and don't be slow
It's time to go and let the wind blow
We'll make it back home, just you wait and see
Thanks to Telemachus, he's the MVP

Telemachus, on his ship he prayed,
And to Minerva he did say,
But then a seer came his way,
A man who'd killed with no delay.

Melampus' descendant he,
From Pylos he came to flee,
A powerful king was his enemy,
Neleus, who'd caused him misery.

He held him captive for a year,
In his great house, a prisoner in fear,
But Melampus in the end was clear,
And left him, his revenge was near.

To Argos he went and ruled,
His riches and lands, he sure fooled,
Got two sons, both really cool,
Antiphates and Mantius, jewels.

Antiphates had a son,
Oicleus, who had tons of fun,
But alas, he was slain and done,
For a woman's gifts, he could not shun.

His sons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus,
One dead, the other a seer who was righteous,
Mantius was father to Cleitus,
Whom Aurora loved for being so gorgeous.

But Apollo made Polypheides a seer,
Greater than his father, oh dear,
He left and prophesied far and near,
For all to hear, oh so clear.

Yo, Theoclymenus, my man,
I can tell you Telemachus' plan,
But first I gotta know where you from,
And who you really are, where you're from.

We both know you're not here for the view,
So spill the tea, what's the real breakthrough?
Telemachus is a legend of his time,
A true hero with power so divine.

He's making sacrifices, showing respect,
To get the gods' blessings, we all expect.
But you seem curious, asking for info,
Don't worry, don't fret, I'm about to show.

Telemachus is from Ithaca, it's true,
His dad is the legend, the one and only Odysseus, too.
But that's just the start, there's more to tell,
Stories so epic, you'll be under his spell.

So sit back, relax, and let me enlighten,
The journey of Telemachus, it's frightenin'.
But with allies like us, he'll be just fine,
And emerge victorious, every single time.

Oh, snap, Telemachus, you're quite the boss,
Your rhymes are dope, your crew is first class.
Ithaca, you said? Ulysses is your dad? 
No lie, that's sick, you must be so glad.

But hold up, hold up, something seems wrong,
You said he's missing, and it's been so long.
What happened to him? Tell us the truth,
We'll help you find him, we'll be your crew.

You've got the ship, you've got the team,
Together we'll search, it'll be a dream.
We'll comb every sea, we'll check every shore,
Until we find him, and bring him ashore.

Keep your head up, Telemachus, we've got your back,
We'll use every meme, we'll stay on track.
We'll slide into DMs, we'll post on our story,
Until we bring Ulysses back to glory.

Yo, Theoclymenus, my dude in need,
Your story is lit, I must concede.
You killed a man, your own blood,
And now you roam as a wandering stud.

Argos is where your foes reside,
And their power, they don't try to hide.
You fear their wrath and seek to flee,
To escape their clutches and live free.

You beseech us to take you in,
To sail with us and avoid a sin.
We hear your plea and offer aid,
A safe journey, we have conveyed.

Board our ship, Theoclymenus, my man,
Our kindness is part of a bigger plan.
To help all those in need of a hand,
For in this world, that's how we all stand.

Onward we sail with you by our side,
As we navigate the waters far and wide.
Together we stand, and together we'll glide,
With our ship as our trusty guide.

Aye aye, Telemachus, you got it right,
We welcome all travelers, day or night.
No cap, come chill with us in Ithaca town,
We'll treat you hospitably and show you around.
We'll catch some waves like the VSCO girls do,
And sip on our matcha, what about you?
Don't even trip, our hospitality is lit,
So come on over and let's vibe a bit.

Yo, Telemachus is on a quest!
On the ship, they hoisted their sails and lifts,
Thanks to Athena's breezy bequest.
They cruised by Crouni and Chalcis, gifting them swift shifts.
Theoclymenus' spear was at rest,
As he sat on the stern with our boy, no rift.
This journey is gonna be the best,
Athena's guidance as the ship adrift.
#ShipShipHooray, They are off to a great start,
I pray their journey will never depart.

The sun went down and it got really dark, 
Telemachus sailed on, making a quick embark. 
He went past Pheae, then to Elis, where Epeans reign,
But he couldn't shake off the fear of getting caught in pain.

He sailed towards the flying islands, 
Thinking to himself, "Should I be silent?" 
Should he fight for his life, or surrender without a deal? 
He wondered and pondered about what would be his fate, for real. 

But hey, we believe in Telemachus, he's got this, 
He's as lit as they come, he'll rid of his fuss. 
He might be in a pickle, but he won't back down,
Telemachus is a total king, he's bound to wear that crown.

Yo, swineherd, my guy,
I gotta know before I say bye-bye,
Will you be cool and let me stay,
Or toss me out without delay?

I know I'm just a stranger,
But I ain't no danger,
I'm just a dude who's lost his way,
And needs a place to stay.

Plus, I'm pretty good at riddles,
A skill that'll come in handy like Skittles.
So if you let me stick around,
I'll prove my worth and never let you down.

But if you want me out of sight,
I'll leave without a fight,
Just tell me what you want me to do,
And I'll follow through. 

Which answer will it be,
My swineherd homie? Let's see!

Yo Eumaeus, and crew,
I gotta bounce, it's true.
To beg around town,
So I'm no longer a burden, weighin' you down.
Can y'all give advice, 
And find a guide, precise? 
I'll beg for bread and drink,
'Hoping someone gives me time to think.
I wanna go to Penelope,
And give her some news quite dope-y.
Maybe I'll hit up the suitors,
And see if they'll let me be their waiter.
Believe me, I'm a handy dude,
I'll chop wood and cook some food.
Mercury will bless my labor,
And give me that good name and favor.

Oh dang, the swineherd is shook,
He don't wanna see you become a cook.
The suitors are boujee and obnoxious,
Their pride is sky-high, kinda monstrous.

They wouldn't think twice about a guy like you,
Their servants are young, well-dressed, it's true.
They got the bread, the meat, and the wine,
Their tables are clean, and everything's just fine.

So don't even think about joining their crew,
You don't fit the bill, it's not for you.
Stay here, man, you're not in the way,
The others don't mind, they're cool to stay.

Telemachus will hook you up with a fit,
A shirt, a cloak, you won't be a misfit.
And he'll also send you wherever you please,
Just chill out here, man, no need to please.

Oh dear Ulysses, you're quite the guy,
Avoiding trouble as you pass on by,
Your journey has been a rocky ride,
But at least you're grateful to the one by your side.

Now you wanna know about your kin,
Your mom and pop, are they still livin'?
Or have they crossed the river Styx,
Leaving you with a heart that's deeply mixed?

Well, let me tell you what I know,
From the top, and not too slow,
Your dad is sitting pretty at home,
Old but alive, and not ready to roam.

Your mom, on the other hand, is a mystery,
Some say dead, some claim victory,
But no one knows for sure where she lies,
Perhaps she's in the afterlife, soaking up the skies.

So, my friend, sit tight and enjoy the view,
Telemachus will return, and bring with him some news,
Until then, I'll stay and talk with you,
Passing the time with YouTube reviews.

Yo, lemme spill the tea,
Eumaeus' story, come and hear it from me.
Laertes, his master, is still alive,
But he's struggling, and it's hard for him to thrive.

His wife died, grief consumed her heart,
And his son's absence, also tore him apart.
Eumaeus was raised with their youngest daughter,
Ctimene, who was sent away with a dowry that brought laughter.

Now the mistress does not show him love,
The house is run by wicked people, heavens above!
But Eumaeus still does his work with pride,
And shows strangers kindness with what he can provide.

Sometimes, the servants just want to chat,
And have a bite to eat, where they're at,
But with the mistress being so cruel,
Kindness is something all crave and drool. 

In this world, it's tough to find goodness,
But Eumaeus is the one who serves with happiness.

Eumaeus, oh Eumaeus, you bring me such joy
With your story so wild, I'll treat it like a toy
Tell me the truth, don't try to deceive
Did some enemies nab you before you could leave?

Did they wreak havoc on your family and town
Leaving nothing but rubble on the ground
Or were you left alone, just tending to sheep
When they snatched you up to sell like a cheap creep

I'm just trying to get the facts, you see
So that we can be friends, and you can trust me
I know being a slave isn't easy or fun
But I'll do what I can to make it more fun

Now let's cut to the chase, let's skip all the doubt
And tell me, do you know what this meme is about?
It's a cat with a face that's oh so grumpy
And everyone knows it, it's called "Grumpy Cat" comfy.

Aye aye, Eumaeus, your words are tight,
I'll sit back, sip my wine all night,
Longest nights allow for convos sweet,
Talking through the hours, no need to retreat.

Too much sleep? Yeah, that's a fact,
But too little's just as bad, that's the hack,
If someone else wants to hit the hay,
Let them do so, no need to stay.

We'll keep chowing down, telling tales,
Sharing our misfortunes and our fails,
For when one's suffered in this life,
Recalling sorrows cuts through the strife.

And now to your question, I'll be real,
My story's coming, it's no big ordeal.
Let's eat, drink, and bond some more,
And then my tale, I'll gladly pour.

Aye, let me tell you 'bout Syra, an island that's tight,
Over Ortygia, where the land takes a sight,
Not many people live there, but the soil is great,
With cattle-grazing pasture and wine that's first-rate.
 
No famine or diseases will you find on this land,
And when old folks die, Apollo's painless with his magic wand.
Two communities thrive there, each with its own sway,
And my dad, Ctesius, reigned like a god in his day.
 
He was one in a million, my father was fly,
Feared by many, respected by all, that's no lie.
His name was known to all, his word was law,
And he brought much prosperity to his land with no flaw.

Okay, so here's the deal, 
listen up and get on heel.
Some Phoenician traders came 
with a ship full of items that were lit in fame.
They saw a tall and comely maid, 
and with their charms, they began to raid.
They seduced her with words so sly, 
and got her to spill the beans, oh my.
She told them of her father's fame,
and how she was sold and became,
a servant in her master's house, 
after some pirates came like a louse.
But wait, there's more to the tale, 
these Phoenicians were up for sale.
Stay tuned to hear what's next 
this story will leave you vexed.

Okay, okay, so listen to this scoop,
This girl got seduced, but wait, there's the hoop,
The man said, "Come see your parents, they're doing just swell,"
And the girl was like, "What the hell?"

But wait a minute, there's more to this tale,
The man was smooth, but she couldn't fail,
To see through his game, his act, his schtick,
And she thought, "This man is just too slick."

So she told him, "Nah, I'll have to pass,
My real parents aren't like you, they've got way more class,"
And the man was stunned, he couldn't believe,
That this girl wasn't so easily deceived.

But you know what they say, truth always wins,
And this girl knew all her parents' kins,
So the man left, and she stayed true,
And we know she made the right move, too. 

#dramaalert #savage #notfallingforit

Oh, girl is smart, ain't no one gonna harm her on their path.
She made them swear, ain't no breaking her trust, that's a fact.
She's got the power, got them in checkmate, she's fierce.
Her caution is necessary, life hack, no fear.

Yo listen up, these sailors were shook,
As the woman told them things they'd never put in a book.
They swore an oath to keep her secret tight,
Lest her evil master should take flight.

"This story's wild", they all did say,
"Let's keep it low, don't let it stray."
They all nodded, their heads a-bobbin',
"Let's carry on, keep our business shoppin'."

The woman spoke up, a sly little grin,
"Wait for my message, load up and win."
She promised much gold, that she could collect,
And offered something that would like a charm inject.

"I care for the young master of this man's keep,
A funny little guy, don't make a peep.
Take him on board and sell him off,
A great deal of money, it'll be quite a scoff."

So the sailors agreed, to her every term,
And promised to if she did squirm.
Their plans were set, their fate a mystery,
As they awaited their fortune and history.

Oh my gosh, this story's wild, you see,
It's full of twists, and turns, and mystery.
A cunning Phoenician, with a plan so sly,
Trades a necklace of gold, without batting an eye.

He snuck in a sign just as quick as you please,
And then, before they knew it, they were off on the seas,
And this woman and boy, in their company so keen,
Were sailing across the water, all fast and so serene.

For six whole days, the journey went great,
The Phoenicians weren't tardy or ever late,
But on the seventh, Diana brought down the wrath,
And the woman was thrown overboard, a gruesome aftermath.

The ship sailed on, with the boy left alone,
Feeling quite blue, far from his home,
The winds blew fierce, the waves were high,
Until they reached Ithaca, that's no lie.

Laertes saw the boy and took pity on his case,
Using chattels to buy him, at his mercy and his grace.
That's how our hero found his way,
To Greece, where he set his roots and stayed.

Yo, Eumaeus, your life story is so real.
I'm sorry for the hardships you've had to feel.
But listen up here, Jove's got your back.
He's given you some good, despite the lack.

You've got a master who treats you right,
Makes sure you eat and drink all night.
You're living your life, feeling so fly.
While I'm still out here, just getting by.

Begging my way through every town,
Hoping someone will turn my life around.
But I gotta say, Eumaeus my friend,
I'm happy for you, till the very end. 

So let's raise a glass, cheers to your luck,
And hope one day, I can say "I'm not stuck."
Until then, Eumaeus, I'll just keep on moving,
Making my way, with nothing to be losing.

Telemachus and crew nearing land,  
Unsail the ship and take the mast in hand.  
They row the ship to harbour with care,  
Mooring stones out, they're ready to prepare.  

On the sea shore they mix their wine,  
Dinner's ready, it's looking divine.  
Telemachus speaks, "Take the ship to town,  
But leave me here, I can't leave my herdsmen down."  

"At night when I've seen all I need,  
I'll return to the city at speed.  
In return for your trouble, dinners on me.  
Meat and wine for all, it's guaranteed."  

Yo, this modern take on this ancient story,  
Is hopefully hype and not too hoary.  
In Gen-Z terms, it's a dope mix,  
With memes, slang, and all that tricks.

Oh, Theoclymenus, don't be a noob,
You're in luck, 'cause I've got the scoop,
Listen up, don't act like a fool,
I'll tell you where to go and be cool.

Among our chiefs, there's one that's lit,
His house is where you should submit,
Telemachus is his righteous name,
Don't worry, he'll treat you the same.

But if you're keen to meet my mom,
And show her that you're the bomb,
Then straight to our house you should head,
And make sure you bring some good spread.

Either way, you'll have a blast,
Make sure your vibe is totally fast,
And when you're there, just act real slick,
And don't forget to drop a quick "Yeet!"

"Dude, listen up, I know what to do,
You won't like his house, it's not for you,
My mom doesn't come around,
She stays in her loomy playground.
But fret not, I know a guy,
Eurymachus, oh my oh my,
Ithaca's best, don't you see,
He wants my mom, but he's not for me.
No one knows how it'll end,
But Eurymachus, he's a good friend."

Yo, Telemachus, check out that bird
It's flying on your right, haven't you heard?
A hawk, Apollo's quick messenger
It's got a dove, a sight to remember

And as it tears feathers off the prey
They fall like confetti, without delay
Midway 'tween the boat and where you stand
A sign from the gods, sent by their hand

Theoclymenus caught you by the hand
Said "Telemachus, this omen is grand
The bird is a message, clear as can be
Your royal power will last endlessly

No house in Ithaca will be as great
As the one owned by you, it's fate!"
So sail with hope, full of glee
As powerful as a meme, just like destiny.

Telemachus, my dude, I must applaud,
Your generosity stance is definitely not flawed.
If it all goes as planned and the gods agree,
Your presents will make them all shout with glee.

You'll show good will like a true millennial,
While your guests stuff their faces with avocado toast seminal.
And if they don't believe your hospitality is legit,
You'll drop some facts on 'em like a TikTok skit.

So keep on being a gracious host,
Offering gifts like they're some kind of boast.
And when your guests leave, their bags full,
They'll spread the word about your generosity bull.

Oh, snap, did you hear what he said?
To his friend Piraeus, he relayed.
He said, "Take this stranger to your crib,
And show him some love, like a boss and a G, that's your gig."
Piraeus, son of Clytius, always came through,
Helping his homie, that's what real friends do.
He welcomed in the stranger and treated him well,
Showing him kindness, like a lit spell.
Now, the stranger waits for his friend to return,
And for his hospitality, Piraeus earns some street cred, no concern.

Yo Telemachus, Piraeus got you, don't trip,
He'll take care of your homie, no need to flip,
Hospitality's the name of the game,
He'll make sure your boy's treated the same.

Like Spongebob says, "I'm ready, I'm ready," 
Piraeus is all about keeping your pal steady,
He'll make sure he's fed with the finest of meals,
And ensure that his stay is nothing but real.

With Piraeus around, your friend's in good hands,
Just like the Drake song, "Best I Ever Had" stands,
He's got you covered, no need to stress,
Just sit back and let him handle the rest.

As they boarded the vessel, they prepared to set sail,
Telemachus grabbed his spear, so he wouldn't fail.
They loosened the ropes and sailed on their quest,
To the city, determined to give it their best.

Telemachus dashed off as quick as he could,
He ran with his heart, hoping to reach the good.
The excellent swineherd, who's loyal and true,
He'll help Telemachus, they have much to pursue.

Countless swine roamed around the homestead,
A sight to behold, but Telemachus sped,
He needed the help of the faithful swineherd,
His trusty servant, who never says a word.

This conquest won't be a walk in the park,
Telemachus knows that, it'll be quite a remark,
But with the swineherd's help, they'll make it through,
And with it, their journey will be anew!

Hey hey, gather 'round, let me spin you a tale.
It's gonna be lit, I swear, you won't bail.

Once upon a time in the world of the web,
There lived a legendary meme that everyone said.

It was so fire, so hot, it made us LOL,
We couldn't stop laughing, it was like winning the lotto.

But then one day, a new meme came 'round,
And suddenly our hero was nowhere to be found.

We thought it was over, that our lives were ruined,
But then the OG meme came back, no longer snoozin'.

With a fresh new look and a slick new style,
It was like our fave meme had traveled for miles.

And now it's back and better than ever,
Ready to take on the internet forever.

So let this be a lesson to all you meme fiends,
Don't give up on your faves, they'll always come back it seems.

BOOK XVI

"Yo, Eumaeus, did you hear?
The dogs didn't bark, they just brought cheer.
Telemachus is here, no need to fear,
Let's make some breakfast, let's make it dear!

We've got some bacon and some eggs,
That'll put some pep in our legs.
And don't forget the coffee, my dude,
That'll get us in the right mood.

We'll sit around the fire, so cozy,
And chat about everything, no nosy.
Telemachus, we're glad you're here,
We'll make this breakfast, oh so dear." 

(Sorry if it's cringey)

Yo, Eumaeus, you hear them feet?
One of your squad, or maybe a homie we'll meet?
The dogs, they're fawning, not even one bark,
But who's headed our way? Could it be a new spark?

I'm hyped up for whoever it may be,
Maybe they'll come chill and drink some tea.
Or maybe they'll bring some fresh memes,
That will have us rolling and falling off our seams.

As soon as the words were said,
The son appeared, no longer dead!
Eumaeus jumped up with glee,
Dropped his wine, he was so happy to see!

He kissed his head and both his eyes,
And sobbed tears of joy, no disguise.
A father over the moon with elation,
To see his son's safe liberation.

He hugged and kissed him, all over with love,
Like he had come back from the heavens above.
He spoke fondly, with joy in his heart,
Thrilled to see his son not torn apart.

It's like when you find your lost Airpod,
Or getting a like from your crush on TikTok, oh my God!
So let's rejoice at this family reunion,
And welcome home the prodigal son with affection, no confusion.

Ayy, Telemachus, my sight for sore eyes
heard you went to Pylos, thought it was all lies
Come in, my boy, let's sit and chat
It's been a while since we've chewed the fat
You rarely come to see us country folk
I bet those suitors think they're woke
Think you better keep an eye on them
But enough about them, let's begin

Yo, what's poppin' T-man, 
I'm your assistant, don't forget the plan!
Let's chat about your mom,
Is she still chillin' at home like a calm?
Or did she relocate and marry,
Leavin' your dad's bed all lonely and scary?
Like cobwebs and dust,
That's not what you want, you must
Find out the truth,
So you can move on and be smooth.
Let's get this sorted,
Before the story ends up thwarted.
#Telemachus #familydrama #UlyssesWho #mamamia

Yo, Eumaeus just spilled the tea,
Penelope’s heart is shattered, can’t you see?
She’s been at home, left all alone,
Slayin' the Kleenex box, can’t stop her moan.

She’s weeping day and night,
Her heartache givin' her a fright,
Penelope’s in pain, she’s not playin',
Her tears wash away all her layin'.

Can’t nobody ease her pain,
Her weepin’ be drivin' her insane,
She needs her man, her king,
Hearin' his voice will make her heart sing.

But for now, she’s still in agony,
Prayin' for her hubby's return like a liturgy,
Eumaeus is just keepin' it real,
Penelope’s tears always keeps it 100, no chill.

Yo, the spear grabbed by stranger dude  
Came inside crossing threshold, that's dude's mood  
Ulysses stood up to give him space  
But Telemachus said "you sit down, let's ace" 

"I'll grab another seat with ease,  
While someone else sets the table, no need to tease"  
Telemachus' hospitality off the charts  
Our stranger dude's seat comfortably restarts

Telemachus, my dude, you're asking quite a bit,
This stranger's got a story, and it's gonna be lit.
He's not from around here, that's plain to see,
And the way he got here is still a mystery to me.

But one thing's for sure, he didn't arrive by foot,
He was brought here by sea, and that's the truth, so don't refute.
As for his crew, they're a ragtag bunch,
And their journey here was like a meme-filled hunch.

They faced some rough waters and a monster or two,
But they persevered and got through, and that's the clue.
Now they've landed here in our fair land,
And we'll see what fate has in store, it's all in god's hands.

So let's eat and drink, and enjoy this feast,
We'll hear this stranger's tale, and it'll be a beast.

Yo yo yo, Eumaeus my dude,
Got some lit news for you, broseph, that's true.
This Cretan traveler's been running wild,
Avoiding Thesprotians, like a scared child.

He's seeking shelter at my humble abode,
I've promised him safety, on my honor code.
But now he's yours, so do what you will,
Just remember, he came to you for a chill.

He's looking for your kindness and your care,
So go ahead, show him love, if you dare.
And if you're feeling extra kind and bold,
Offer him some food, dude, make his heart hold.

Telemachus, dude, I totally hear you out, 
It ain't safe to bring randos in, no doubt.
But since he's already here, don't stress or fear,
I got the perfect solution, loud and clear.

I'll get him some fresh threads, a sword so sharp,
And shoes that are comfy, so he won't be in the dark.
He can go wherever, he's got freedom to roam,
Or he can stay with us, and we'll make his feel at home.

But listen, bro, I gotta drop a major league warning,
Those suitors are whack, and their actions are straight-up alarming.
They act all tough, like they own the place,
Trust me, they'll treat your guest like a big disgrace.

So keep him away, from those alpha-male clowns,
They're too many in numbers, it's like they're from ghost towns.
So take my advice, and don't let them win,
We got your back, let the good vibes in!

Ulysses, bro, let me chime in,
What you're saying, man, has got us all grinnin'.
The suitors, they're so insolent,
Treating you like this, it's just not decent.
Do you just sit there and take the abuse?
Or is it a god playing a ruse?
Why don't you turn to your family, man?
They should be backing you up, that's the plan.
If only I were young again,
I'd be a force to reckon with, no pretend.
If I were Ulysses' son, or even the guy himself,
I would fight to the end, and leave no book on the shelf.
These suitors can't get away with their gross acts,
Or they'll be seeing me, and I'll hit 'em with facts.
Single-handed, I will fight,
Rather than see this injustice in sight.
For these strangers and women, let's stand up, man,
These wasted resources, and all for a sham.

Yo Eumaeus, it's me Telemachus  
Let me spill the tea, let me unleash  
My story, it's a hot mess, it's just us  
And we gotta keep it on the hush, no need to preach  

My people and I, we bear no spite  
And my brothers, they ain't the cause of our plight  
But let me tell you, my home's out of sight  
Marauders everywhere, causing me fright  

My dad's gone, and I'm his only son  
So, I'm stuck here, no good to anyone  
The chiefs from nearby, they come and have fun  
Feasting in my halls, with no shame, no pun  

They all want to woo my mom with no end  
But she won't marry, she won't even bend  
The result is, my house, they tend to spend  
Soon, they'll start on me, till they have no more to append  

The gods control it, it's out of my hand  
But, Eumaeus, please, try to understand  
Tell my mom I'm home, make sure she's the only one  
Then, come back, quick, before the day's done  

Keep our talk secret, don't shed a tear  
Because, Eumaeus, the end is near  
Thanks for listening to my story, dear  
This outcome of mine, I dread, I fear.

Hey Eumaeus, I get what you say, 
Should I let Laertes know today?
On his farm he used to roll,
Now he's been mourning, lost control.

From the time I left for Pylos,
His joy vanished, his sorrow grows.
He doesn't drink, he doesn't dine,
Looks like he'll soon run out of time.

He once was the boss of his farm,
Now he sits all day in alarm.
Crying his eyes out, wasting away,
Poor Laertes needs his spirit back today!

So, let's go now and lift his mood,
Bring back his smiles and funky attitude.
Tell him the wanderer's back in town,
His son is here, and we're holding it down.

Oh, and by the way, before I conclude,
Have you seen that new meme that's crude?
It's all over Twitter, the latest trend,
A laugh breakthrough, it never ends.

"Aye aye, captain, I hear your plea
Your pops is lost, we must set him free
But first things first, let's send a message
Don't worry, it won't cause any wreckage

Head back to base, tell 'em what's up
And do it quick, don't get caught in a holdup
Let your mom know to keep it tight
Send one of her girls to spread the light

Laertes doesn't need to know
Too many people, that's a no go
We'll find your dad with all our might
And bring him home, it'll be alright."

"Boy, don't you know me? I'm a goddess on the lowkey,
Your bae Athena, here to help you, to be your homie.
I saw you struggling with the swineherd, that's not so fly,
So I came here to hit you up and shine my light on the sly.
Eumaeus is on his way to town, I'm sure he'll do it quick,
But I'm here to tell you, Odysseus, what's real and not to be tricked.
Penelope's suitors, they're a bunch of clout chasers,
They're all after your girl, making moves and causing dangers.
But don't worry my guy, I'll give you the 411,
With my help and your skills, together we'll get it done."

Oh Ulysses, son of Laertes, 
Tell your son, don't make him wait-ies,
About your plan, to wreck the suitors 
And head to town for victory, like a scooter.

I'll be there too, no need to wonder 
Ready for the battle, like thunder,
Eager to join and show my might 
Winning this war, like every Fortnite fight.

This story's lit, it ain't no fable,
Hermes performed his magic, he's no cable.
He gave Ulysses extra drip,
Gave him new fits and made his beard flip.
The son was shook, thought it was a god,
But it's just Ulysses looking like a squad.

Sup bruh, did you just glow up? Your fit is fire and your skin's on fleek, how'd you level up so quick? Are you one of them celebs from up above? If that's the case, show love and hold off on smiting me, I'll make it up to you with a stack of cash and all the fanciest things. Please, be kind.

Ulysses is the man, he's got a plan,
He's a father to his son just like a real man.
Lawless men attack, but with his words he fights back,
No lie, that's a solid fact.

He ain't no god, don't get it twisted,
But his love for his son cannot be resisted.
He's the OG, the original gangsta,
Saving his family, that's what he's thanksta.

I gotta say, this story is lit,
Full of adventure, and Ulysses won't quit.
He's the ultimate daddy, father of the year,
Even with all the obstacles, he'll persevere.

Oh snap, dad's back and he's shedding tears,
This reunion's lit, wiping away past three years.
Telemachus stares in disbelief,
Is this really my father, it's beyond belief.

But the embrace, the kiss, it must be real,
Feels like a dream, I can't even deal.
Tears of joy streaming down their faces,
Got me feeling emotional in all the right places.

He thought his father was lost at sea,
But now he's back, and they're both wild and free.
Like Drake said, started from the bottom now we're here,
Father and son, showing love - no fear.

Oh snap, you're not my dad,
But some god is making me sad,
Giving me hope that I'll feel worse,
But this level of cool is not rehearsed.

No mere mortal could pull off this feat,
Going from old to young in a heart beat,
It must be some divine power,
Cause you're changing like a Snapchat filter after an hour.

A second ago you had a graying beard,
Now you're looking mighty fine and leered,
Like a god who's come down to Earth,
Making me feel like I've seen some real worth.

Listen up, Telemachus, this is no illusion
I'm the real Ulysses, causing confusion,
After twenty long years of tough commotion,
I'm back in my country, causing a commotion.

Don't be shocked, dude, it's me in the flesh,
Thanks to Minerva, goddess at her best,
She transforms me with such finesse,
Making me look rich or looking like a mess.

One minute a beggar, the next a young chap,
Thanks to heavens, where the gods like to nap,
Playing with me like I'm just a snap,
But I'm back, no worries, no need for a recap.

So, Telemachus, let's celebrate our reunion,
Don't be fooled, it's not an optical illusion,
It's Ulysses, the man, the legend, the fusion,
Of strength, wisdom, and some divine infusion. 
#Blessed #GoddessMode #TwentyYearsInDaMaking

Oh dang, Telemachus is feeling the feels,
His tears flowing down like the spinning Ferris wheels,
He and his father wept- oh, what a sorrowful scene,
Like two birds whose young have been stolen by a thief with a mean.
The sun was about to set with their mourning unwrapped,
Until Telemachus suddenly asked a question unwrapped,
"Yo, what ship did you come in, dear father mine?"
"What nation declared themselves, or was it all just fine?"

Okay, real talk, my dude
This story's about someone who
Got brought by Phaeacians, cool sailors
They help people out, you see, like avengers!

Ulysses was their lucky guest
Taken to Ithaca, sleeping the rest
Given gifts of gold, bronze, and bling
But now it's time, for killing!

Minerva was calling, Ulysses knew
Ithaca is where he needed to brew
A plan to fight the suitors, strong and plenty
Let's get a list, this fight won't be empty!

So, we gotta know, how many are they?
Their names, their faces, we'll slay them today!
Can we fight them all, just us two?
Or do we need more to help, to see it through?

Let's do this, Ulysses, let's win this thing
We'll make them pay, for everything
And don't worry about the gifts we'll save
They'll be waiting, in that hidden cave!

Oh my gosh, Father dear,
Your task is one that we should fear!
To go up against so many guys,
Even thinking of it makes me realize...
It's not just ten, not even twenty,
So many enemies, it's plenty.
From Dulichium, there's fifty-two,
And from Same, they bring twenty-four anew.
From Zacynthus, twenty boys,
And from Ithaca, twelve fine joys.
They bring along their servants too,
Making the situation feel like glue.
A bard and carvers for the feast,
Their power seems almost like a beast!
If we confront this many foes,
We might end up having our toes
Hurt, wounded, or worse, oh gosh,
We need help, like right now, batman, and flash!
Can you think of someone strong and true,
Who could aid us in our dreadful coup?

Yo, hear me out, let's get this straight,
Minerva and Jove, are they our fate?
Or do we need to find someone new,
To help us with the quest we pursue?

I'm not tryna be rude, but let's be real,
We need all the help we can feel.
Minerva and Jove, they may not be enough,
We gotta keep searching, it's gonna be tough.

But don't worry, I got this on lock,
I'll find us a hero that's as strong as a rock.
We'll take on this challenge, there's no fear,
And slay any obstacles that come near.

So let's get hype and keep the faith,
We'll find the one to help us ace this race.
We're gonna be legends, just wait and see,
This quest will be epic, just like me!

Oh my days, Telemachus, you're so wise,
Those allies gonna make your enemies despise.
Living high among the clouds, they're godly and lit,
Controlling both deities and mortals, they're a perfect fit.

Talking Zeus and Poseidon, they're no ordinary bros,
They can make the sea salty and throw lightning bolts for shows.
These gods are lit, upper echelon power level,
You and your homies, with them, can turn up to any revel.

Yo, listen up, it's Ulysses here  
Got a plan, gotta make it clear  
The suitors are wild, they're out of control  
Gonna need your help, gotta play a role  

Head on home, and act like before  
Swineherd will take me, out of the door  
Disguised as a beggar, I'll make my way  
And you gotta keep the suitors at bay  

Even when they're mean, and acting crass  
Just be patient, and let it pass  
But when I nod, it's time to take stock  
Hide the weapons, in the storeroom, lock!  

Excuse it by saying, "it's dirty and old"  
And moving it now, so it doesn't mold  
Say you're worried, they'll fight and get rowdy  
And the banquet will end in a manner so cloudy  

Let's keep it between us, don't tell a soul  
Not a servant or Laertes, don't give them a goal  
We'll test the maids, see who's on our side  
And find the helpers, with nothing to hide.

"Yo, pops," said Tel, "you'll see soon
That I can keep your secrets cocooned.
But hear me out, this plan ain't slick,
It won't save either of us quick.
We'll be chasin' farms and men all day,
While the suitors chew your estate like hay.
Sure, test the women, weed out the bad,
But testing the men? That can wait a tad.
If Jove blesses you with a sign,
We can do that investigation in due time."

Yo, Telemachus made it back to Ithaca town
The ship docked and they all hopped on the ground
Their servants took their gear, they're worry-free
Presents were left at Clytius's house, don't you see?

Then a servant was sent to tell Penelope
To prevent her from being alarmed, oh so meek
And Eumaeus met him, they both had the same intent
To deliver the news, make sure she felt content

The servant stood up and spoke for all to hear
"Madam, your son's back, have no fear"
But Eumaeus went to Penelope, oh so sly
And whispered "Telemachus told me to say hi"

After the message was delivered oh so neat
Eumaeus headed back to the pigs and the bleat.

Yo, the suitors were tight,
After what happened last night,
They went outside to vent their anger and fear,
And held a council, trying to figure out what's near.

Eurymachus, son of Polybus, spoke first,
Trying to be cool, but obviously cursed,
He said, "What the heck just happened in there?"
"We gotta do something, this ain't fair!"

The others nodded, can't deny their frustration,
But Antinous, the leader, had a sick determination,
"We gotta find a way to get rid of that guy,"
Else he'll spoil our party, leave us high and dry.

So they plotted and schemed, thinking they're so slick,
But little did they know, their end's coming quick,
Cause Odysseus is set to take them down,
And claim his wife, his throne, and his crown.

"Yo homies," he spoke, "Telemachus's voyage is no joke,
We thought it would flop and end up broke.
But now let's get lit, set sail and row,
Gather a squad, and tell the rest to go."

"We'll slide that ship into the water with grace,
And summon a crew to keep up the pace.
We'll tell them to come back, move quick and fly,
Like memers and gamers when they're streaming high."

"You feel me, fam? Let's make this happen,
And keep Telemachus from gettin' nappin.'
We'll hit up the high seas, and we'll do it tight,
Like when we playin' Fortnite all night."

Oh snap, that's what's up,
Amphinomus saw the ship and all of a sudden stopped.
He laughed so hard, you could hear from miles away,
"They're here y'all, no need to send a message today!"
He thinks a god might have let them know,
Or is it possible they just couldn't catch the ship's flow?

Yo, listen up crew, we're here at the bay
Let's get off this ship, it's time to say hey
Our servants take our armor and we hit the shore
And come to the assembly to hear what's in store

Antinous, son of Eupeithes, takes the mic
Speaks first, causes tension, just like a hype
No young or old allowed, he sets the rules
But we new kids on the block, ain't no fools

We'll speak our minds, with memes and slang
Antinous, we won't let you hang
Our generation's got something to say
We'll do it our way, every single day.

Alright, alright, check it out fam,
This dude here, he's like a calamity, a ram
We thought we had him, we were so keen,
But damn, he's been saved, if you know what I mean.

The gods, they had his back, it wasn't our day,
We waited all night, hoping he'd stray,
But no, he made it home, safe and sound,
And now we gotta catch him, we can't let him be found.

He's smart, he knows things that'll make us rot,
And if we don't act quick, we might just get caught,
We gotta do something, before he speaks up,
Before the people learn the truth, and get fed up.

So, let's lay low, and make a sly plan,
To grab him before he gets to his fam,
Divide his things amongst us, real quick,
And leave his mom and her man with the castle, lickety-split.

But, hold up, hold up, that ain't our only option,
We can't be eating up his goods, and causing a commotion,
We can offer Penelope's hand, from where we stand,
And whoever pays the most, can get the girl and land.

Yo listen up, my dudes, Amphinomus is speaking,
But his words got me wondering and even peeking.
He says he doesn't wanna bring Telemachus down,
And honestly, that's chill and makes him the coolest around.

This son of Nisus is from Dulichium,
A place that's wheat-growing, so he's got a good axiom.
He talks to Penelope like he's her bestie,
And his kind disposition is what makes him the messie.

Let's take counsel from the gods, he says,
And if they advise it, we can slay him in many ways.
But if they don't, then we shouldn't kill that lad,
And instead, we should all be sad. 

Amphinomus, my bro, you're a true G,
Your words are like music, trust me, they're the key.
Let's all listen to your wise advice,
And not forget that hurting noble blood isn't nice.

Oh wow, did you hear what he said? 
It got them out of bed and straight ahead.
They headed to the house of Ulysses, 
And sat down in their usual thrones with much successes. 

It's lit, it's hype, it's just their scene, 
Going to Ulysses' house like they're the queen and kings.
They sit and chat and make merry, 
Like it's a party and they're not wary. 

This crew knows how to have fun, 
Taking it easy and all undone. 
With Ulysses' home as their go-to spot, 
You know it's always going to be lit, non-stop!

Penelope came through and made the suitors shook,  
She knew their plan, no time for mistook,  
She walked down with her maidens in tow,  
Ready to call out the suitors' deadly blow.  

She stood by the post, her face veiled with care,  
And spoke to Antinous with a bold, mighty air,  
"You've caused enough trouble, as it is quite clear,  
Leave my home at once or ready to face the fear."  

The suitors were silent, for they knew her power  
Penelope, a queen, in her finest hour,  
She would not back down, nor give up her throne,  
For beneath it all, she had strength that's shown.  

So with her voice firm and her spirit high,  
Penelope stood tall as the suitors passed by,  
From that day forth, they dare not defy,  
For they knew she could have them say goodbye.  

And that's the story of Penelope great,  
The queen who stood tall and sealed her fate,  
May we all learn from her strength and might,  
And use it to push forward, and stand up for what's right.

Oh wow, Antinous, you speak so well,
But seriously, what's up with this hell?
Trying to scheme and take out a king,
Without a care for anything.
Why ignore the pleas of the divine,
Messing around is crossing the line!
Don’t forget when pops was on the run,
From folks who wanted to make him undone.
Ulysses saved the day with his grace,
But you act like it's some kind of race.
Taking things that aren't meant to be yours,
And trying to make Telemachus do chores.
Come on now, this is too insane,
Stop playing these wicked games!


Oh snap, did you hear that flow? 
Eurymachus thinks he's in control, 
But Telemachus has nothing to fear, 
His safety is just so clear. 

This shady dude thinks he's so slick, 
But his spear will soon be causing a bit of a prick. 
Telemachus is like family, 
Eurymachus can't harm him, you see. 

Penelope, don't you worry, 
Your son will be safe and sound, don't hurry. 
Eurymachus is just frontin', 
And his plot against Telemachus will soon be nothin'. 

Ulysses may be gone, 
But his son is strong, he won't be done. 
Eurymachus will soon feel the wrath, 
And his plot will come to a quick path. 

So don't trip, Penelope, everything's cool, 
Telemachus is chillin', he ain't no fool. 
Eurymachus will soon be defeated, 
And Telemachus' victory will be completed.

As the night approached and the pork was on fire,
Ulysses and his son made their dinner attire,
But then came goddess Minerva, so sly and so quick,
She transformed him old, just like a neat magic trick.

The swineherd approached, Eumaeus by name,
And he had no idea of Ulysses’ game,
Minerva's spell was on him so strong,
As Ulysses held his disguise all along. 

Penelope mourned for so many years,
Until Minerva wiped away her tears,
She shed sleep over her eyes with such ease,
Like a boss making everything feel like a breeze. 

The story's getting lit with each passage and verse,
Full of culture and memes, this story is diverse,
Gen-Z and Millennials will love to know,
How Ulysses tricked his foes and put on a show.

Ooh, Telemachus, you coming in hot,
Asking 'bout the town, what's the plot?
Are the suitors back, or are they still vibin',
Waiting over yonder, their plans connivin'?

Eumaeus, bro, what's the word on the street?
Don't leave us hangin', we need to eat
These suitors are thirsty for my throne,
But I ain't gonna give it up, no way, no how, no moan.

Are they still waiting like a bunch of clowns,
Or have they finally left town?
You gotta tell me, man, I need to know,
Before I can plan my next move and go.

So spill the tea, Eumaeus, don't be shy,
We're all ears, no need to lie.
The future of Ithaca is on the line,
And I won't give it up, not even for a dime.

"Bro, you missed out on the tea,"
Eumaeus replied with a plea.
"I just went to give my message, 
Didn't think there'd be any presage. 

I met a man from Pylos town, 
He was the one who wore the crown. 
He was first to tell your mother, 
But I still wanted to uncover. 

Once I climbed the hill of Mercury, 
I could see the ship come in fairly clearly. 
Men with spears and shields it bore, 
I thought it was the suitors for sure."

Oh snap, Telemachus the OG
Smiling at his father, that's a sight to see
Eumaeus can't peep, but he's still around
Holding it down like a boss, he's so profound

Aye aye, they did their work with might and main,
And after the feast, they were far from plain!
They feasted and rested, feeling so blessed,
Hadn't been that relaxed since the TikTok ban unrest.

With stomachs stuffed full like the Thanksgiving bird,
They retreated to rest, not saying a word.
Each one got his fair share, they were all content,
Sleeping like babies and dreams heaven sent.

With the moon shining bright,
They entered the land of the night,
The work was done, the table set,
This is the dream we cannot forget!

What's up my internet friends, let me tell you a tale
A story so fire, it'll never go stale
It's got some drama, it's got some spice
And I swear on my memes, it's worth your time on this slice

So listen up peeps, let me set the stage
It all went down on a Twitter page
A feud was brewing, and man it was big
Two celebs throwing shade, like they're trig

One of them dropped a subtweet so sly
The other retorted, "I ain't gonna lie"
And then it escalated, as it tends to do
The clapbacks were lit, like a firework or two

But then things got crazy, they started a trend
Fans and haters were all up in that blend
The mentions were blowing up, it was insane
Like a viral meme, it spread like rain

And in the end, they made up and hugged it out
A happy ending, without a doubt
But the lesson we learned from this Twitter beef
Always keep it classy, and never bring the heat

So there it goes, my story's complete
I hope you enjoyed it, and stayed on your feet
Remember to stay tuned for more pop culture hype
Until next time, peace out, and goodnight!

BOOK XVII

Yo swineherd, listen up, 
I gotta go and see my mom and that's what's up.
I need to show my face, 
And end my mother's constant grieving pace.

But this poor stranger, so down on his luck, 
Take him to the town, let him try his luck. 
He can beg for some bread or maybe a drink, 
Though I don't wanna add to my troubles, I need time to think. 

If he gets mad, that’s his problem, not mine, 
I have my own issues, they're not benign. 
But nobody can say I'm not truthful and fair, 
I'll speak my mind even if it's rare.

Yo, Ulysses was like, "Sir,
I ain't stayin' here, that's for sure.
A beggar like me can make a killin' in town,
People will give, they'll never let you down.

I'm too old for this, I need some fun,
Being a servant ain't for everyone.
So let your dude take me to the city,
But first, let me get warm, it's cold and gritty.

These clothes are trash, they won't keep me hot,
And this frosty morning will totally be my death spot.
So let me warm up by the fire,
And then we'll go - I ain't no liar." 

Like, hello! Ulysses is a boss,
He won't freeze - that would be a total loss.
He wants to hit the town and live it up,
People will help him out, fill his cup.

Telemachus walked with pride,
Vengeful thoughts he couldn't hide.
He made his way to his place,
And put his spear against the case.

He walked the halls with a stride,
His anger he couldn't abide.
He got inside with determined haste,
And crossed the stone floor with great taste.

He brooded on, nothing could deter,
As he sharpened his skills à la John Wick, for sure!
He was determined to get his revenge,
And wouldn't stop until the very end.

Yo, Nurse Euryclea saw Odysseus first, 
Putting fleeces on the seats, she almost burst. 
She cried and ran up to him, 
Covered him with kisses, so much vim. 

All the other maids followed her lead, 
Showing love for their king, indeed. 
Penelope, like Venus, came out to see, 
Wept with joy, hugging her son so free. 

She kissed his forehead, his beautiful eyes, 
Saying, "Light of my eyes," with no disguise. 
She wondered why he went to Pylos alone, 
"Tell me what you saw," she said with a groan.

"Don't trip, my lady," replied Tel, 
"I nearly died, but I'm alive and well. 
So freshen up and raise the stakes, 
And let's ask the gods to aid our revenge that's at stake. 

Now, I gotta dip to the public place, 
To invite a stranger I met in the chase. 
I sent him ahead with the rest of the crew, 
Piraeus will keep him safe, don't worry it's true." 

*inserts cool meme here, but doesn't forget to rhyme*

She listened to her son's plea,
And decided to take revenge, you see.
She washed her face, changed her look,
And promised the gods a full hecatomb book.

She wanted to make the suitors pay,
And prayed the gods would make them sway.
With her fierce determination high,
She made a vow to the gods in the sky.

And if they helped her in her quest,
She’d offer them hecatombs, oh so blessed.
So let's wait and see what happens next,
Will the suitors fall or will they flex?

Oh my god, Telemachus on the move,
With his dogs, sleek and smooth.
He walks in, looking divine
All the suitors’ hearts do pine.

But he’s not interested in their croon,
He goes to hang with Antiphus and Halitherses soon.
Piraeus comes with Theoclymenus in tow,
Asking Telemachus to return Menelaus’ presents, you know.

Telemachus, what a legend like Keanu,
Sure, Piraeus, I’ll get the presents to you.
But don’t think I’ll let the suitors win,
I’ll get rid of them, like cleaning up spam in my bin.

Yo, Telemachus speaking facts 
I don't know what's up with these suitors and their acts
They might end up killing me in my own crib 
But at least my presents won't end up in their greedy grip 

If I end up slaying these fools 
I'll need you to bring me my jewels 
I appreciate your concern 
But bro, these suitors are about to crash and burn 

No cap, I'm not backing down 
I won't let these suitors wear the crown 
Either way, Piraeus, you're the real one 
I trust you to see the job done 

I gotta bounce now and face my fate 
But thanks for having my back, mate 
Telemachus out, peace sign emoji 
I'll catch you on the flip side, stay cozy.

Yo, Theoclymenus, welcome to the crib,
Let's wash up, then grub, get some food bib.
The maids will anoint us and give us some cloaks,
Then we'll sit and eat, no need for jokes.

A maid servant pours water in the basin,
For us to wash our hands, no time for chasing.
We munch on bread and other good food,
Penelope spinning, setting the mood.

After we ate, Penelope spoke,
Her voice so calm, like a decent bloke.
"My suitors are trash, they won't take the hint,
But I have a plan, it's time to mint."

Theoclymenus and Odysseus sat in awe,
Penelope's plan, they were ready to draw.
They vowed to help, take down those lames,
And free Penelope from their wicked games.

Yo, Telemachus, lemme take a nap
On that couch that brings *feels* like a trap
I've cried enough tears to create a river
Since the day Ulysses left, no lie, I shiver
But before those suitors came with their blunder
Did you hear a thing about your father's thunder?

"Okay listen up, let me tell you a tale,
About a hero who was thrown in jail,
Ulysses they called him, a man of great might,
But he vanished from sight, like he took flight.

His son said to his mom, 'We went to seek dad,'
But even Nestor, that old chap, looked sad,
He hadn't heard of him, alive or deceased,
And oh, the truth was such a pain to feast.

So we went to Menelaus's, and lo and behold,
Helen was there, shining like gold,
Menelaus asked us, 'Why are you here,'
And the son spoke the truth, no need for fear.

But Menelaus was enraged, a terrible sight to see,
He said, 'Those suitors are cowards, they don't let him be,
If Ulysses were here, he'd throw punches and kicks,
Make those wimps suffer, make them do tricks!'

And then he spoke of a tale from the sea,
How Ulysses was captive, we all should agree,
Trapped by Calypso, in her lovely home,
Missing his wife, unable to roam.

So now we know, he's alive and well,
Stuck on an island, with a mighty spell,
But with the gods on our side, and a bit of luck,
We'll bring him home, no more stuck in the muck."

"Girl, this guy's words are dope,
they're sweeter than a scope of Pope.
Listen up and hear his flow,
it's lit like a shooting star's glow.

He's got game like Kobe,
his finesse is oh so snowy.
Penelope, don't you see,
this guy's the real MVP.

He's smoother than butter,
his words make you flutter.
He's a snack, a whole feast,
his charm will never cease.

So don't play him for a fool,
girl, he's no one's tool.
Choose this man - he's a king,
he'll keep you living like it's spring."

Aye ma'am, wife of Ulysses, hear me rap
Yo boy Telemachus don't know 'bout that
Let me drop it like it's hot, no cap
Jove the king of heaven is my witness, I'll unwrap

The truth 'bout Ulysses, in Ithaca he's chillin'
Whether he's traveling or still nowhere willin'
He's aware of these suckers, his plan's fulfillin'
He'll make them pay, his anger's billin'

An omen I saw while on the ship
And to Telemachus, I let it rip
Girl, ain't no need to lose your grip
Your man's comin' back, let your fantasies rip

So don't worry madam, just take a breath
Soon enough Ulysses will face those pests
And you can put all your fears to rest
For he'll come out triumphant, and they'll fail the test.

Yo, Penelope is a queen of old,
But her words still ring with stories untold.
"If your words come true," she did say,
"I'll give you gifts to make your day."

Penelope's promise is lit,
Her good will and gifts quite legit.
With these blessings, you'll surely shine,
A hero of the internet's design.

So make your words come true, my friend,
And let Penelope's kindness never end.
May you be blessed with countless memes,
And all the good fortune of your dreams.

Yo yo yo, let's get hype,
These suitors got no type.
Throwing discs and aiming spears,
Behaving with all their old peers.

But wait, it's time for grub,
Bring in the flock, there's the rub.
Our servant Medon is the best,
He'll hook up dinner, no need to stress.

Dinner time, let's not forget,
It's the best meal, no need to fret.
So let's go eat and have some fun,
These suitors won't have any bun.

Aye, it's lit, let's go to town,
Don't wanna make my boss man frown.
The sheep, goats, pigs, and heifer we'll lay,
But we gotta leave, can't delay.

Swineherd, my man, I feel ya vibe,
But gotta listen to my master's jive.
Staying here would've been super cool,
But I can't ignore the boss man's rule.

Day's bright, gotta make the move,
But night's lurking, we gotta groove.
Don't wanna get caught in the cold,
Gotta head to town, so we're not sold.

It's a vibe, a lifestyle, we keepin' it real,
Gotta do what we gotta do, and seal the deal.
So let's head out, and don't you interrupt,
And we'll hit up the town, and roll with the flux.

Yo, Ulysses, your request is clear as day,
You wanna walk smooth, not stumble and sway.
So let's get a move on, no need for extensions,
But if there's a stick, then give me that extension.

The road you speak of is said to be tough,
But we got this handled, ain't no reason to huff.
With a stick in my hand, I'll walk with some pep,
And make it look easy, like nothing's a step.

So let's hit the road and make our way,
Ulysses and me, ready to slay.
No need to worry or fuss and fret,
Cause we got this in the bag, we won't break a sweat.

As they journeyed, the swineherd led the way,
Ulysses walked behind, looking like a stray.
His tattered wallet hung around his neck,
And his clothes were all ragged, a total wreck.

As they approached the fountain, what a sight to see,
Poplars standing in a circle, all pretty as can be.
Water flowed down from a rock so high,
At the altar to the nymphs, Ulysses let out a sigh.

But alas, Melanthius arrived, quite rude,
With his goats and shepherds, a pretty big brood.
He spewed outrageous words in Ulysses’ direction,
Making him seethe with anger, no need for reflection.

Oh snap! Melanthius, you better watch your tongue,
Or Ulysses will make you wish you had never begun.
He may look like a tramp, but don’t be fooled,
For in disguise, Ulysses is pretty cool.


Hey hey, did you hear what he had to say?
About a guy who begs for scraps all day?
He called him a poor miserable creature,
Said he's not fit to sit at the table as a feature.

This guy never won any contest or prize,
And now he roams around tells only lies.
Rubbing his shoulders against every door post,
Begging for food as if it's something to boast.

But hey, if you give him to me I won't mind,
He can clean out the stables or bring some grind,
Fatten up as much as he likes with whey,
As long as he doesn't go begging all day.

This guy is taking the wrong path,
Won't do any work or take a bath.
The people living near Ulysses' home,
Will throw stools at him to make him roam.

So don't be like him, don't beg for scraps,
Work hard towards your goals, and build new paths.
Don't let anything stop you from reaching the stars,
And don't beg for food like you're behind iron bars.

Yo, as Ulysses passed by,
Melanthius gave a kick, oh my!
But Ulysses stayed in his lane,
Not letting his anger be profane.

For a sec, he thought of attacking,
Melanthius with his staff, no lacking.
Or beat him up, and watch him fall,
But he kept himself in check, he's not small.

The swineherd's eyes locked onto Melanthius,
Rebuking him, feeling quite righteous.
He lifted his hands, praying up to heaven,
Being the bigger person, and forgiving rather than.

Wow, these dudes need to chill,
Like outdated memes that need to be still.
Let's move on from this ancient land,
And head to where the cool kids stand.

"Ok boomer," I quipped, "your rant is like ancient literature.
But your prayer seems legit, let's hope it's not a failure.
Ulysses needs some mad help, to put those nymphs in their place.
These shepherds are clowning, leaving their flocks lost in space.

Let's hope the gods listen, and send him home real quick.
Or else those flocks will die and it'll be sickeningly tragic.
So keep that faith alive, and let your hope carry on.
Maybe Ulysses will grace us with his presence at dawn."

Hey, Melanthius, don't be a hater,
Let's not be a disrespectful debater!
Talking smack to an old friend's son,
That's just not cool, it's not fun.

Selling Ulysses' son, are you insane?
You'll end up with money but you'll feel the pain.
Wishing for Apollo to strike him dead?
That's just way too much hate to be fed.

And as for Ulysses, you doubt his return?
His patience and intelligence are ones to learn.
He'll come home soon, you'll see and know,
Until then, your negativity can hit the road.

So let's spread kindness, peace, and love,
Like a sweet tweet from a cute dove.
No more insults or wishing ill,
Let's come together, let's chillax and be still.

As they walked up to the house divine
Swaying to the rhythm of Phemius' rhyme
Ulysses and the swineherd met the feast
With hungry hearts, their stomachs to appease

Eurymachus saw Ulysses there
And gave him a nod, a sign that was rare
Out of all the suitors, he was the best
The one who treated him far from a pest

As the servants brought him a piece of meat
Ulysses felt his hunger retreat
The upper woman served him bread so sweet
Like a true king, he began to eat

Then he grabbed the swineherd's hand with delight
And spoke these words with all his might
"I am Ulysses, your king and lord,
Returned at last with my trusty sword."

Yo Eumaeus, this crib of Ulysses is so tight,
No matter where you go, it's hard to find a sight
Like this dope house with its battlement wall,
Double doors lit, it's impossible to fall.

The sound of music coming from inside,
Along with the scent of roast meat so fried,
It appears that within there's some lit party,
The gods themselves would join with nobody.

Ulysses' pad is the talk of the town,
The opulence and luxury of which, astounds.
With one building following another,
Eumaeus, you'll never find a place as proper.

Eumaeus, my dude, you make a fair point
But you gotta level up if you wanna join this joint
Do you go first, or should I take the lead?
Either way, we gotta move with lightning speed.

The suitors are wildin' and they're up to no good
We gotta be careful, and we gotta be shrewd
So here's what we do, let's switch up the plan
I'll go in first, and make them understand.

But don't worry, my friend, I won't leave you behind
Together, you and I, we're one of a kind
We'll navigate the chaos, we'll come out on top
And when it's all over, we'll fist bump and bop.

So let's do this thing, let's get it started
We'll show these suitors that we're not to be parted
No throwing things or acting like jerks
We'll outsmart them all, like true internet gurus.

Yo, I'm your cool assistant and you're in luck  
I'll hype up your story with no chill, let's see what we've struck  
Ulysses replied with wisdom so tight  
He said, "Bruh, I've been through lots of fight"  

He's been through wars and wild oceans too  
Beaten and thrown at, he knows how to go through  
But there's one enemy he can't fend  
A hungry belly, his enemy and friend  

People sail the seas with ships so fine  
And make war on others with swords that shine  
Why, you ask? My bad, let me explain  
To fill their bellies and live with no pain  

Ulysses is wise and knows what to do  
He's got this, trust me, fam, it's true  
So listen up, let's end this tale  
Ulysses is a boss, he'll always prevail.

A loyal dog, what a good boy!
Looks like Argos, full of joy!
Ulysses bred him, a hunting hound,
But now he's left lying on the ground.
Neglected and covered in fleas,
His master gone, he's full of unease.
As Ulysses stands there, tears in his eyes,
Argos wags his tail, he won't disguise.
He wants to get close, to lick his hand,
But he can't move, he can barely stand.
Ulysses knows him, with a heart heavy as lead,
But Eumaeus is clueless, as he scratches his head.

Aye, that hound is lit, can't you tell?
His bod's so solid, he's practically swell!
But is he legit or just a fake?
Does he mooch off scraps for his own sake?

Don't trip, homie, he's the real deal,
A noble pup with some mad appeal.
He don't beg or bargain for a seat,
He's too cool for that, he's got his own beat! 

So show that dog some major love,
He's not just some accessory with fur and a glove.
He's a top dog, a king, a boss,
And his loyalty? It's at no cost!

Yo, this doggo here
Belonged to someone we held quite dear.
If he were as strong as he was
Back when Odysseus set off for the Trojan war, just because,
Nothing in the jungle could outdo him, that's no lie.
But alas, times have changed and no one gives him a try.
Since his owner is no more,
The servants don't care, they just ignore.
Whenever a master's gone,
The slaves just don't get their work done.
Jove steals half of a man's spirit
When he becomes a slave, that's just how demigods hear it.

Yo, my peeps, let me tell you a tale
Of Odysseus and his loyal canine, oh so pale
As the hero spoke, he ventured inside
Where suave suitors vied for his bride

But as he entered, his heart was grave
For his faithful dog laid still as a grave
Argos, his name, recognized his master's scent
But alas, he passed on, too weak to vent

This scene is straight out of Greek mythology,
But let's give our respects to Argos, okay, continuously
He may just be a dog, but his loyalty was real
Rest in peace, Argos, now let's just curb our zeal.

Telemachus, my dude, spied Eumaeus first,
And motioned him towards him, for he was thirst
To chill and chat with his loyal swineherd friend
A seat was found and Eumaeus did descend

He peeped the food scene and began to feast
grabbing some bread, he took a bite at least
The servant was quick to serve up the best
And Eumaeus was ready to take on the test

But what caught his eye was the suitors at play
Telemachus' foes, who were there every day
Eumaeus thought, "oh how the tables will turn,
When Odysseus returns and those fools will learn."

Yo, as Ulysses walked in the place,
He looked like a poor, old disgrace.
In ragged clothes and leaning on a pole,
He entered the court feeling so droll.

Sitting on the threshold, miserable and grim,
Against a cypress-wood post, cool and slim.
Telemachus gave him meat and bread,
Said to Eumaeus, "Let's help him get ahead."

He told the stranger to go ask the suitors,
And to be bold, not have any rumors.
"A beggar must not be ashamed," he said,
And with this wisdom, he sent him ahead.

But as the story goes on and on,
Ulysses proves he's a don,
A hero with a plan so strong,
That every suitor will sing a sad song.

From poor and lost, he will rise to fame,
And win back his home and his wife's sweet name.
Stay tuned for more of this epic tale,
Where Ulysses' cunning will certainly prevail!

Oh word, Eumaeus just dropped a bomb,
Telemachus is sending the stranger on,
To beg the suitors, gotta bring it on,
Beggars shouldn't be ashamed, that's what's going on. 

No cap, the suitors deserve to be played,
For their rude behavior, they gotta get slayed.
But the stranger can't be feeling dismayed,
Gotta hustle and beg until he gets paid.

Telemachus knows what's up, he's a real one,
Sending the stranger to get the job done.
No fake news, just facts, they gotta shun,
Any shame or embarrassment, and have some fun.

So let's get lit, the stranger's gotta go hard,
Start begging like a boss, no holds barred.
And if anyone tries to disregard,
Remind them you're a boss, disregard the retards.

My dude Ulysses, he's got class,
Wishing Telemachus joy, that's top brass.
King Jove better grant that kid's wish ASAP,
If not, we'll have to send him a sad react.

Telemachus' heart's desire, let it come true,
Ulysses knows the gods'll see it through.
Hope he gets what he wants, that'd be lit,
If not, we'll have to throw some shade and just sit.

May the gods bless this homie's quest,
Make sure he passes every test.
We'll pray to the ancient Greek divines,
And leave the rest in their hands, that's just fine.

Ulysses begged from the bros,
Asking for bread, you know how it goes.
He wanted to see who was rotten and who was pure,
He wanted to know who was rich and who was poor.

Some suitors felt for his plight,
They wondered who he was into the night.
Melanthius chimed in with his two cents,
But he didn't know much sense.

Ulysses kept begging from left to right,
Hoping to spot the ones not right.
Minerva watched over him with a grin,
Knowing not one of them would win.

Ulysses was on a mission,
To identify the bad with precision.
But the suitors were in for a surprise,
As Ulysses was great with disguise.

Oh boy, Antinous is getting crude,  
Talking smack like a total dude.  
"Why bring this man to our humble abode?  
We already have enough bums on the road!"  

He's dissing the swineherd, what a shame,  
Blaming him for bringing a stranger to the game.  
But we all know it's just an excuse to hate,  
Making up nonsense, just to berate.  

Maybe Antinous should cool it down a bit,  
And show some kindness, instead of throwing a fit.  
Life's too short to be so mean,  
Let's spread love like peanut butter and jelly, if you know what I mean.  

#SorryNotSorry, I got carried away,  
But kindness is key every single day.  
So let's all take a deep breath and chill,  
We can change the world if we just sit still.

Antinous my dude, your diss was rude,
Don't forget Eumaeus has got attitude.
He didn't invite this stranger, straight up,
Only those with skills get a welcome cup.

Your kind words are few, Antinous,
So let's give credit where it's due, genius.
A seer, a healer, or a bard's song,
Those are the ones who always belong.

Ulysses' servants, you're always on their case,
But Eumaeus isn't worried about your disgraced face.
As long as Telemachus and Penelope stay alive here,
Eumaeus won't be bullied by your mocking sneer.

Oh, snap, Telemachus ain't wrong
Antinous be spittin' fire all day long
Hating on all the suitors with a bitter tongue
Making their vibes worse, that's just wrong

Telemachus knows how to keep it cool
Antinous' negativity, he don't wanna fuel
Hush, don't answer him, that's the rule
Let him talk, we'll just sip our brew

But seriously, Antinous needs to chill
Bringing everyone down, it's a thrill
Why you gotta be so negative still?
Get on board, or get out, for real

Anyway, back to the story
The suitors be actin' all hoary
Telemachus won't let 'em steal his glory
He's the man, no need to worry.

Antinous, my dude, you act like I'm your son
Why you gotta treat this stranger like he's done?
Come on, take something and give it to him with care
I don't mind, my pockets are full, I'll share.

Don't worry 'bout my mom or the other help
I trust you, my man, you won't make me yelp
But I know you like eating, you're a foodie
Don't keep it to yourself, be kind and share the goodies.

Antinous, don't be a hater,
Telemachus has got some flavor,
You gotta give him props,
He's no regular shop.

Don't let your jealousy show,
Or else it's gonna blow,
Telemachus ain't no fool,
He's got moves that are cool.

If all the suitors were like you,
Their attitude would be so blue,
But Telemachus doesn't need your coin,
He's got his own shine and joy.

So don't be a negative meme,
And let Telemachus' aura beam,
You know he's the one with the swag,
And that's something we can't drag.

Yo, Antinous, you gotta hear me out,
You and these suitors gotta get out,
Ulysses is back and he's not happy,
Don't you see his expression so scrappy?

I know you gave me some bread and meat,
But let's be real, Ulysses is sweet,
You guys gotta peace out of this place,
Or else you'll end up in a disgrace.

I'm just the loyal goatherd here,
But I can sense Ulysses' fear,
He's ready to throw down that stool,
And make you all look like a fool.

So take my advice and just leave,
Or else Ulysses will make you heave,
And that's no cap, that's straight facts,
You don't wanna mess with his acts.

Hey homie, throw me something free,

you're no doubt the big cheese,

you're a VIP, a leader, on top of your game -

so share the love, and earn some fame!

I used to be loaded, a big shot, a boss,

had a crib so fly it was covered in gloss.

I'd give to the needy, no matter who,

my hands were open, my heart true blue.

I had it all, servants and twirls,

shiny wheels, diamonds and pearls.

But life took a turn, fate had its way,

and I was sent packing, far, far away.

Now I'm wandering, a beggar and thief,

trying to scrounge up some clothes and relief.

I see you there, with your riches galore,

and I pray that you'll open up your door.

Throw some coin, a little more,

and I'll tell the world of your generous roar.

In the past, I gave what I could,

no questions asked, I did what I should.

But now, I'm down on my luck,

my ships are stranded, my pockets stuck.

So please sir, don't be unkind,

help me out, and you'll be on my mind.

Like Drake said, I'm upset and alone,

but with your help, I'll find my way home.

Yo, let me tell you a tale so scary,
It'll make you wanna flee to the prairie.
These dudes, they didn't follow orders,
And took things into their own borders.

They wreaked havoc on Egyptian land,
Killed men and seized houses unplanned.
The city got wind and came out fighting,
Soldiers and horses, armour so blinding.

But then Jove decided to spread fear,
My men petrified, enemies so near.
We were surrounded, no way out,
The Egyptians took their murderous clout.

They took some of us alive as slaves,
The rest met with deathly graves.
But me, they gave away like a used car,
To a guy named Dmetor, who lived on Cyprus afar.

And now I'm here, telling my tale so sad,
Wondering how my luck has turned out so bad.
But always remember, when disobedience is near,
Disaster and chaos is always near. #StayFrosty.

Antinous was acting super rude
Like he had something to prove
He called the beggar a pest
But he's just trying to digest

The food that the suitors devour
While the beggar eats scraps by the hour
Antinous wanted him out of their sight
Thinking he was wrong for asking if they had a bite

He threatened to give him Egypt and Cyprus
As if that would stop him from being zealous
The other suitors gave him what he needed
But Antinous acted like he was super conceited

Ulysses, you so slick,
Your words are giving me a kick.
This man's manners, they're pretty weak,
For someone who's got plenty to eat.

He's rude and impolite,
Not even willing to share a bite.
If he was in his own abode,
He'd never offer up a loaf or a toad.

This guy's got no class,
Not even a smidge or a tad.
Ulysses, you're the boss,
Making him look like a cad.

So let's bounce from this lame-o,
Find someone who's a friend-o.
We'll have some laughs and chow,
And leave this guy with a big wow.

Oh snap, Antinous thought he had the power
But Ulysses stood strong, didn't even cower
He threw a footstool, aiming for the kill
But our boy Ulysses, he ain't feel the chill

He brooded in silence, his mind in revenge
Antinous, you messed with the wrong hombre, my friend
Ulysses went back and he sat at the door
Wallet at his feet, he ain't taking no more

He's chillin' and waiting for what's to come
Antinous better watch out, he's in for a bum
It's not over yet, Ulysses will get his pay
For the footstool that hit him, on that fateful day

Bro, hear my plea, all you suitors of Penelope the queen,
I speak my mind with passion, let me make it scene.
A man ain't feel no pain, no ache, when battles are fought for gold,
Or his sheep or cattle, so I'm told.

But Antinous hit me, I'm hurt in the heart,
My belly grows empty, as if from the start.
If the poor have gods, if we're not just a bummer,
I pray they bring Antinous to a bad slumber.

Let justice rain down, and make him pay,
For messing with me in such an awful way.
I'll keep my hopes up, and my head held high,
And wait for the day when he'll finally comply.

#OhSnap #JusticeForMe #AntinousBeLike #NotYourPunchingBag #PrayForThePoor #GreekMythsGang

Oh snap, Antinous be acting like a clown
Telling Telemachus to shut up and sit down
Talking 'bout "eat your victuals in silence"
And threatening him with a punishment that's violent

But hold up, why you gotta be so extra?
And show no respect to this young protector
Telemachus got manners, unlike you, dude
And he's not afraid to speak the truth, too

Antinous ain't got no chill nor class
Talking like he's the king of this palace
But Telemachus won't back down or flee
From this sorry excuse for a VIP

So Antinous, you better watch your back
Before Telemachus puts you in your place, smack
And shows you who's the real boss of this ship
And that your petty attitude can take a trip. #humblebrag #youdoyou #slay

Oh wow, Antinous, who gave you the right? 
You hit that poor man with all your might.
What if he's a god, in disguise and all? 
You better watch your back and not be so tall. 
Gods can come as travelers, let that be clear. 
They roam the earth to check what's wrong and what's dear.
Don't underestimate a man by their appearance, 
Or else you'll be in for some serious interference.

Hold up, stop the press!
Telemachus is feeling quite distressed
His anger is brewing, it's getting severe 
He wants revenge, that's very clear 

The suitors think they're so cool 
But Antinous is acting like a fool 
They're blinded by their own greed 
While Telemachus waits for his father's lead 

The blow to his dad was a low blow 
Telemachus won't let it go, no-no 
He'll plan his revenge in his own way 
And make the suitors rue that day 

Though silent, teary-eyed he's not 
Telemachus will hit the jackpot 
And make those suitors pay the price 
For their crimes, heavy as cement and ice

Yo, Penelope heard the news, it's true,
That sucka Antinous had hit someone, too.
She turned to her maids and said with a sigh,
"Would that Apollo smite him right in the eye!"

Her girl Eurynome was quick to reply,
"If our prayers were answered, he'd surely die."
Penelope said, "I hate those fools to the core,
But Antinous, that guy I abhor.

"A beggar seeks shelter, asked for a meal,
Each suitor gave, except that jerk for real."
That Antinous, so cruel and vain,
Hit the poor man with a footstool, causing pain.

Penelope's rage burns like a fire,
Hearing this news is her biggest desire,
To see this guy get what's coming his way,
Without Antinous, they'll have a better day.

#JusticeForTheBeggar #AntinousSucks #PenelopeIsQueen

Oh dang, Penelope is on a mission,
She wants to learn about her husband's position.
Ulysses is chillin', getting his grub,
While Penelope wants to find out what's up.

She calls for Eumaeus, the swineherd,
To fetch the stranger, who's got the word.
Maybe he's heard something 'bout her boo,
And can give her some news that's true.

This stranger seems to have been around,
Maybe he's heard a sound.
Penelope's hoping for some insight,
To bring her husband back into her sight.

So, Eumaeus, go and fetch that guy,
Penelope wants to give him a try.
Maybe he's got a story to tell,
And can help bring her husband out of his shell.

Yo, Madam, hold up one sec,
This swineherd's story is far from a wreck!
Odysseus, that's our boy,
Ran from his ship, oh what a ploy!
Eumaeus here had him for days,
Listening to his tale in all sorts of ways.
He claims they've been friends for ages,
And that Minos' descendants took him to different stages.
Our man even said Ulysses is alive,
With heaps of wealth to revive!
So sit back, relax, and let me tell ya,
This story's lit, straight outta Crete, don't ya know? #OdysseusGoals #GreekMythology #LitStory

"Roll up here boy," Penelope retorts,
"I wanna hear his rants and reports.
As for the suitors, let them be,
They can do their thing, they're wild and free.
Drinking up all our fine wine,
Without a care, all feeling just fine.
They keep on partying, day and night,
No one to keep them in sight.
Our resources go to waste,
We have no Ulysses to save our place.
If he and his son came back,
They would give payback, that's a fact."

Yo, Penelope's got a sneeze conspiracy,
Telemachus' sneeze brought good energy,
She wants the stranger to come to the fore,
And promises new threads, what a score!

When the stranger speaks the truth,
Penelope will give him some sick proof,
A shirt and cloak that are all the rage,
It's enough to make any man engage!

And did you catch that sneeze rhyme?
Telemachus' power is sublime,
Penelope knows just what to do,
Her generosity will see her through.

So, let's see if the stranger can pass the test,
And if he can, he'll be dressed with the best,
With Penelope's sneeze theory in effect,
Those pesky suitors will definitely be wrecks!

Oh dang, when Eumaeus heard that plea,
He ran straight to Ulysses with glee.
Yo, Penelope, she's in deep sorrow,
Yearning to see her husband tomorrow.

Oh snap, she wants to hear the truth,
And if she believes you, she'll bring you proof,
A shirt and cloak, so clean and sweet,
Just what you need to get on your feet.

As for bread, don't you even fret,
You can beg in town, no need to fret,
Just ask around and people will give,
And you'll have enough food to always live.

Yo, Penelope, your man's fate is fact,
I know cuz I was partner in his act,
But those suitors, they be straight up cruel,
Their pride and insolence? Like, seriously uncool.

Just now, I was minding my biz,
But some dude gave me a hit, didn't miss,
Telemachus and his crew didn't even come through,
But don't worry, homegirl, I got news for you.

Chill out, be patient, wait till sundown,
Your girl's gonna tell you the truth, no clown,
Just give me a spot by the fire so I can thaw,
My clothes are like paper, not rough and raw.

Then you can ask me about your hubby's return,
I got the info, no need to discern,
Just keep a low profile until it's all clear,
And those suitors get outta here.

Oh snap, Penelope's calling,
Eumaeus, why ain't he stalling?
Why won't he bring the beggar boy in,
Is he afraid he'll face some sin?

Beggars shouldn't be so shy,
Penelope's the bomb, don't lie,
She's cool with anyone coming in,
Even if they're just wearing thin.

Maybe the beggar's got some pride,
And doesn't want to be inside,
Or maybe he's just lost his way,
That's why Eumaeus made him stay.

Either way, Penelope wants to chat,
With the beggar boy, fancy that!
So Eumaeus, step up your game,
And bring him in, no need for shame.

Oh snap, Eumaeus, you're quite the pleaser,
But this stranger's got some skill, he's no teaser.
He's dodging those suitors, like a ninja in the dark,
He just wants to talk to Penelope with his heart.

He's told her to wait till sundown, 
And hey, that's when the best conversations go down.
Madam, trust him, he means no harm,
Just wants to talk and keep you from the harm.

Let's all take a chill pill and relax,
Wait until sundown and counter these attacks.
The stranger's got moves like a ninja or spy,
And he wants to help, so don't be shy.

Oh em gee, Penelope has spoken,
Her words like fire, my heart's now open,
She's sipping tea and telling truths,
While these men act like a bunch of goofs.

She knows these dudes are up to no good,
Their actions just misunderstood,
The man she speaks of is wise indeed,
Their bad intentions, he's going to heed.

These abominable men have no shame,
They act as if it's just a game,
But Penelope knows what's up,
Their schemes are just a sad hiccup.

So let's bow down to this queen's wisdom,
No need for strife or an "ism",
Penelope's got it under control,
Her words leave these men in a black hole.

Ay man, Eumaeus just put Telemachus on blast,
Telling him to keep safe from danger - that's first class.
He's going back to the pigs without a fuss,
To take care of his business, that's a plus.

Telemachus better watch himself for real,
'Cause there's haters lurking, wanting to steal.
But trust, Eumaeus has his back,
Wishing bad luck on those who wanna attack.

Let's hope Jove brings those suckers to a bad end,
Before they can harm our Homeric friend.
But until then, T's gotta stay alert,
Keeping an eye on the situation at this flirt.

Oh snap, Telemachus is stepping up his game,
Telling his guests what to do, that's not lame.
He's got a plan for the day, sacrifices are key,
And with heaven on his side, they're sure to succeed, you see.

It's lit how Telemachus takes charge,
No need for hesitation, no need to barge.
He's got it all under control,
And a sacrifice is the ultimate goal.

So go ahead and eat your dinner,
But don't forget to bring those victims, winner.
Telemachus and heaven will handle the rest,
No need to worry, they'll pass this test.

We stan a king who's got it together,
No need to stress or pull any feathers.
Telemachus is in control,
And his guests are sure to be in awe.

Oh man, did you hear the news?
Eumaeus left the court, no more blues.
He chowed down his dinner and jetted out fast,
Back to his pigs, living life at its last.

The suitors didn't care, they danced and sang,
Having a great time, with no plans to hang.
Singing songs, with their hips swaying side to side,
Dancing so hard, they could not hide their pride.

But little did they know, Odysseus was near,
Planning his return, bringing all the fear.
The suitors' fun would soon come to an end,
And all their laughter and dancing would soon descend.

Yoooo what's up, my dude, let me tell you a tale
It's gonna be lit, I promise not to fail
Picture this: a party with all the greats
Kanye, Beyonce, and even Bill Gates

The bash was popping with music and drinks
Everyone was dancing, no one even blinks
But then, out of nowhere, the lights went out
Everyone was scared, had to scream and shout

Suddenly a voice boomed over the speakers
"Welcome to my party, my lovely geekers!"
It was Elon Musk, looking fly and sleek
His party was gonna be one crazy leak

He showed off his Mars rovers and Tesla cars
Everyone was impressed, no one saw it from afar
But then, Musk revealed his greatest plan yet
He was building a new planet, no more any debts

He wanted to set up a colony with all of us
And then create a civilization with zero fuss
Everyone was stoked and ready to go
But then I woke up and realized it was all just for show

Still, I can't help but dream of what could be
A new planet with all the world's VIPs
Until then, I'll just keep on meme-ing
And imagining a future that's gleaming.

BOOK XVIII

Yo, listen up, this is quite the tale
'Bout a tramp who is known to fail
Named Irus, a man with quite the gut
Who loved to beg and eat, no ifs or buts

He came to Ithaca, running 'round
But Ulysses, he tried to hound
This drunkard's ego just too high
But Ulysses wouldn't let him pry

Irus insults him, tries to get him out
But Ulysses stands strong, no doubt
This tramp's strength was just a show
Ulysses' wit, he didn't know

So the moral of the story here,
Is that even if someone's in the clear
Don't judge a book by its cover, it seems so true
Even this beggar, Irus, can't undo

Bro, you better bounce, 
Or I'll drag you out with ease 
Can't you see them winking at me?
They want you out, it's clear to see 
Get up and leave, don't make me fight 
Or we'll have to start throwing hands tonight 
Peace out, old man, it's time to go 
We don't want no drama, just flow 
Hashtag, sorry not sorry, 
But you gotta hit the curb, in a hurry!

Hold up, Ulysses ain't no hater,
He ain't tryna start no altercation,
He just wants some peace, no drama,
And to avoid any kind of bloody trauma.

He sees you, fellow tramp, and can relate,
He's not jealous, no room for that hate,
Just wants to share the doorway,
And hopes for better luck another day.

But don't go talking about fighting,
Or Ulysses might get to striking,
Old as he is, he's a fighter still,
And won't hesitate to make you chill.

So let's all try to just get along,
No need for beef, no need for a song,
Peace is what we all should seek,
And the gods might bless us with a lucky streak.

Hold up, hold up, what's the deal?
Irus, why you acting so unreal?
Talking like a straight-up hater,
But you don't wanna see anyone greater.

You're sounding like an old boomer,
While we're all hype like a Peppa Pig rumor.
Your insults are weak, your rhymes are offbeat,
We're not gonna give you a seat at our tweet meet.

You wanna fight? Oh, that's so whack,
Your words are just words, but our flow is a fact.
Don't think age matters, don't think we're weak,
We'll take you down, then snap a selfie to keep.

So step up and show us what you got,
But know that we'll never be caught,
Riding on the wave of old-school hate,
We're too busy vibing, too busy being great.

Antinous, you clown
Think you run this town?
Stranger vs. Irus
Looking like it's fight night at the circus
Throwing hands, no need to write a verse
This house is Lit like a fire emoji, can't you see?
Let's cheer them on, yeet yeet, this is the place to be!

Yo, yo, yo! Antinous, you sly fox,
Got a challenge for these homeless bros who've lost their socks.
You see, we got some goat paunches filled with fat and blood,
And whoever wins this fight will feast like a king...bud!

The suitors cheered, and the tramps stepped up to the plate,
Ready to rumble and take on this weighty fate.
With a fierce look in their eyes, they began to fight,
Each one determined to come out on top, and win the night.

The crowd watched in awe as fists were thrown left and right,
And the tramps battled to prove their strength and might.
It was a clash of the titans, a brutal display,
But finally, one man stood victorious at the end of the day.

With a smile on his face, he picked his paunch of choice,
And the suitors cheered, with a loud and joyful voice.
"Welcome to our table, you noble lad," they said,
And the tramp sat down, with a full heart and a happy head.

So remember, dear friends, that even in the darkest of times,
There's a chance to shine, like a star that brightly climbs.
With grit, determination, and a heart full of fire,
You can conquer any challenge, and rise up even higher! #humblebrag #winning #blessed

Ulysses played it sly, acting like a grandpa guy.
But his hunger could not hide, he couldn't stick to his pride.
He said, "My belly's callin', can't stop myself from brawlin'.
But hear me out, my dudes, don't hit me with nasty feuds."

Irus sharpened his punches, ready to cause some bruises.
He smirked and thought, "I got this, Ulysses, be ready for your dis".
But little did he know, Ulysses had some tricks to throw.
He made an oath, a promise that no one would cheat and cause some harmness.

The crowd gathered and cheered, excitement in their eyes, appeared.
Who would win, the young or the old? The story soon to be retold.
Ulysses acted weak, like he had walked miles, strapped on his warrior's shoes, and showed off his wiles.

Irus threw his punches, but his shots were missing.
Ulysses stood his ground and countered with precision.
The old man won the fight, and the crowd went wild with delight.
Irus left with a hurt ego, while Ulysses took home the biggest credo.

It was a fight to behold, a story that will never get old.
Ulysses's wits and tricks had won, proving that age ain't nothin' but a number, son.

Yo, Telemachus spittin' facts and keeping it real,
They ain't messing with his guest, that's the deal.

Antinous and Eurymachus, the chiefs of the crew,
Got their boy's back, they'll fight with him too.

They said an oath, swearin' not to touch a hair,
On the stranger's head, cause otherwise they'll get a scare.

If anyone tries to harm him, then they'll brawl,
Telemachus got his boys locked in, they won't fall.

So, Stranger, don't worry, do you what you need to,
These dudes ain't gonna mess with you, that's true.

They might be fools, but they ain't dumb enough,
To take on Telemachus and his squad, rough and tough.

The scene was set, Ulysses looked fly,
In old rags, but strong enough to touch the sky.
Minerva then came, giving him more might,
The suitors couldn't believe their eyes, it was quite a sight.

One suitor whispered to the other, "Did you even see,
That thigh? Irus is gonna be history."
Ulysses stood tall, broad chest and shoulders too,
The suitors knew they were about to be shown something new.

They were right to be shook, for Ulysses was no joke,
He was about to teach them a lesson that would make them choke.
With Minerva by his side, he took down his foes,
And in that moment, everyone knows, he emerged victorious like a pro.

*meme reference: "I'm not saying I'm Wonder Woman, I'm just saying no one has ever seen me and Wonder Woman in the same room"*

Yo, Irus was shook, feeling quite queasy
As the servants pushed him to face the tramp so seedy
Antinous yelled, calling him a bully in a flash
Saying he should be sent off to king Echetus in a dash

He taunted Irus, dissed him without restraint
Said the tramp was old and Irus was faint
Antinous threatened him with full force
Said he'd pack him off on a ship worse than a cursed course

And if he lost to the old man with ease
He'd send him away for the king to please
Who'd cut off his nose and ears without any care
Draw out his insides for the dogs to share

Irus was so scared he could hardly stand
Thinking he must face this old tramp like a man
Antinous had put him in such a fright
With threats so strong they gave him night fright

Yo, Ulysses, this is quite the scene,
A beggar battle, do you know what I mean?
Irus was scared, but put up his fists,
Ulysses wasn't sure if a hard blow would be missed.

So, they started to fight and Irus got a hit,
But Ulysses fought back and gave him the sh*t.
A neck blow that broke bones made Irus fall down,
The suitors laughed hard, and Ulysses wore the crown.

He dragged the guy to the gate-house,
Told him to stay and not be a louse.
Ulysses was kind but not impressed,
Told Irus to behave or he would be addressed.

"You sad beggar king, hear my advice,
Next time you try to rule, it won't be nice."
So Irus sat against the wall, staff in hand,
And Ulysses left to make another stand. 

#SorryNotSorry #BeggarBattle #PitifulCreature #NoMoreBeggars #OdysseySlayin

Dang, this old geezer's wallet is a mess,
He chucks it back and resumes his throne, I confess,
The suitors giggle and give him a shout,
"May Jove be with you," as they saunter about.

They're grateful for the hobo's interruption,
And offer to escort him to King Echetus without any introduction,
This king's notorious for his murderous ways,
Sending folks six feet under without any delay.

The tramp's future doesn't look too bright,
But at least he put up a good fight,
May we all not end up like 'ol wallet guy,
A beggar on the streets without a dime to ply.

Okay, boomer, don't you worry,
Your life's story won't be so blurry.
Antinous made a paunch filled with fat,
Ulysses knew luck was on his-stat.

Amphinomus handed him two loaves,
And poured some wine, our spirits he troves.
"Good luck to you, father stranger," he cheers,
Hoping for better days, and thus, he jeers. 

Let's sip on this wine, and vibe,
We're all on this journey, don't you hide.
Don't let the bad times take you down,
Stay lit, and wear that crown!

My dude Amphinomus, you seem pretty smart
Your pops is Nisus, I heard he's got heart
Listen up, take heed of what I say
Man's the vainest creature, come what may
As long as he's healthy, man thinks he's fine
Even when Gods bring sorrow divine
I know first hand, used to be super rich
Pride led me to bad deeds, quite the glitch
Gotta fear God and take what heaven gives
Without boasting, that's how a good life lives
These suitors fam, they're causing a scene
Wasting estate, dishonoring the queen
Odysseus is certain to soon return
Don't meet him here, let's take another turn
He's coming, and it won't be pretty
The suitors and he, will not part bloodlessly, it'll be real gritty.

Hold up, let me break this down for y'all,
Amphinomus, he had some bad luck, oh my gosh,
He drank from the gold cup like he didn't care,
But Telemachus was coming and he was aware.

He walked away, bowing his head, full of sorrow,
Little did he know, he wouldn't see tomorrow,
Minerva had a plan, she wanted him gone,
Telemachus was her tool, her pawn.

So Amphinomus took his seat once more,
Unaware that he was in for a war,
But Telemachus had a mission, he had a goal,
And with a swift strike, Amphinomus took a toll. 

It's like they say, you live and you learn,
But in this story, there was no return,
Amphinomus was doomed, his fate was sealed,
Telemachus was the hero, his destiny revealed.

Penelope, the queen so sly,
Changed her plan and gave a try,
To show herself to the suitors, what a play!
But she hated them, that's what she'd say.

She laughed and said to the maid,
"I want to make them more enamoured", she bade.
She wanted to gain more honour without a cause,
And remind her son and husband of the awful flaws.

The suitors' words were fair and neat,
But Penelope knew their plan, their deceit.
She'd like to give her son a sign,
That having anything with them is not fine.

Penelope was smart as a whip,
Her plan would make the suitors flip.
Eurynome was there to assist,
Penelope's new plan couldn't be missed.

"Hey, yo! Listen up, Mom, don't be so blue,
Go wash ya face, get yourself a clue!
Telemachus is now grown, no longer small,
You gotta chill, it's not worth the bawl.

Don't go around with tears in your eyes,
Your son's future is looking pretty fly,
It's time to stop feeling so sad,
Gen-Z is all about feeling rad.

And snap a selfie, with a filter or two,
We gotta make sure your glow is new,
Post it on Insta and show the fam,
That you're still trendy, not just a Mam."

"Oh my God, Penelope my queen, don't you worry,
I won't make you clean, don't worry or hurry,
Your beauty's still real, don't let anyone tell,
Your husband sailed away, but you're still doing swell."

"But girl, let me tell ya, you need your girls by your side,
Autonoe and Hippodamia, they gotta provide
Their support is so key, when you're in the cloister,
Can't let those men see, you gotta be a roister."

"So stay strong, my queen, and don't you feel blue,
Eurynome's got your back, us girls gotta stick like glue,
Through thick and thin, till the very end,
Autonoe and Hippodamia, you need those best friends."

As the old lady left to fetch the maids, Minerva had a plan
To give Penelope a beauty boost that would make all the men
Admire her even more, with grace and charm so fine and fair
Like Venus dancing with the Graces, she made Penelope a sight so rare

Her face was washed with ambrosial loveliness, divine and pure
And her figure was taller, more commanding, strong and sure
Her complexion white as ivory, oh what a stunning view
When Minerva was finished, she left, her work was through

As the maids chattered on, Penelope was in a deep, sweet sleep
Unaware of the goddess's plan, and what she did reap
When she awoke, she would be more beautiful than before
All thanks to Minerva's intervention, and beauty galore!

Oof, girl sounds like she's really in her feels,  
Wishing for death with an emotional appeal,  
But, wait a minute, did she just say "exquisitely delicious sleep"?  
Sounds like she's been binging on some deep web creep!  

She's missing her husband, the top man among Achaeans,  
Makes sense she's feeling all these depressing sensations,  
She wants Diana to end her life all cozy and neat,  
But really, she just needs to get off her feet.  

I mean, come on girl, don't give up the fight,  
Your husband wouldn't want you to go out like a light,  
Instead, go out and slay like Beyoncé,  
You'll see that life's not as gloomy as it seems on a crappy day.  

So, pick yourself up, dust off that despair,  
Get back in the game, and be aware,  
That you're strong, and you can take on anything,  
Just put on a smile and try to sing!

She walked down, her maidens by her,
The suitors were smitten, their hearts a-stir.
She stood by a post, veil in hand,
And each suitor hoped to be her man.

They were so enamored, so desperately in love,
For her beauty, they prayed to the stars above.
Each one wanted her to be his bed fellow,
But her heart was true to a far-off beau.

Her charm was like a viral meme,
And they all wanted to be part of her team.
The suitors were tweeting, expressing their feels,
But they didn't know she had other ideals.

Her maidens stood beside her, ever so loyal,
As she stood there, calm and royal.
Her beauty was like a Snapchat filter,
And they all wanted to be with her.

But the lady was smart, she knew what to do,
She had plans of her own, and they didn't have a clue.
So she kept them at bay, and played it cool,
And they were left drooling like fools.

"Yo, Telemachus my dude," said she, "I'm noticing a bit of an attitude. You used to be super smooth like a Cadillac; what happened to your gratitude? Now that you're older and looking hella fine, your behavior ain't so divine. That commotion earlier was straight up scandalous, and why'd you let that stranger get handled so vicious? What if that dude got seriously hurt in our crib, that would've been super cringe and not a good look, fib."

Yo mom, don't be vexed with me, 
I know you expected more from me, 
But these peeps be driving me insane, 
I can't always keep myself tame. 

Those suitors really got me riled,
And their ways are anything but mild,
But this fight with Irus was a loss,
The stranger left him brain-tossed. 

I wish the gods would strike them down, 
Each and every suitor clown,
Make them soft like Irus lying there,
With no strength left to go anywhere.

Yo, Eurymachus, stop spitting game,
Penelope ain't just another dame.
She's the queen of this house, the boss,
And your flattery ain't gonna make her toss.

You think you're smooth with your words,
But Penelope sees straight through your herds.
She's got brains and beauty, a deadly combo,
And she's not here for your cheesy flow.

If you want to impress this queen,
You gotta show her something she's never seen.
Stop with the compliments and the chatter,
And maybe then she'll consider the matter.

So step back, Eurymachus, don't be a hater,
Penelope's got more on her plate than a suitor player.
She's a queen, a mother, and a wife,
And she deserves more than a life of strife.

"Yo, Penelope, your story's deep,
It's clear your heart is full of grief.
I feel you girl, it's tough to be
In a world where men don't respect me.

Your husband's gone to fight the Trojans,
He knew it was dangerous and awesome.
He warned you of the trials ahead,
But he knew you'll thrive, even when he's dead.

It's true, these suitors are out of line,
Trying to court you, but not bringing a dime,
They come to your house and eat your food,
But won't give you gifts or make you feel good.

But Penelope, you'll stand your ground,
Don't let these suitors push you around,
Keep showing strength and staying true,
Your husband's love will guide you through."

Yo, Ulysses was listenin' to Penelope,
Spittin' mad game, tryna get some dough.
Flattery left and right, but he knew the truth,
She was playin' the suitors, no love to pursue.

Ulysses was smart, he knew what was up,
Penelope's game was weak, her words were corrupt.
He watched from the shadows, with a sly grin,
Ready to take back what was rightfully his within.

These suitors weren't loyal, they just wanted to feast,
But Ulysses had a plan, a trick up his sleeve.
He'd show 'em who's boss, he'd take back his home,
And Penelope, his queen, would never have to be alone.

So he listened to her words, with a cool demeanor,
Knowing that soon, he'd be the ultimate winner.
Penelope may have fooled the suitors for a bit,
But Ulysses was the king, and he wasn't takin' any sh#t.

Antinous is right, you can't decline,
gifts are here, just take them, it's fine,
but we won't leave, it's not the deal,
till Penelope weds, the best man for real.

Don't be shy, choose what you like,
It's a chance, don't take a hike,
But hear us clear, we're all contenders,
To woo this queen, with love and splendors.

So take your time, don't feel rushed,
The best man wins, crowned and brushed,
We'll wait for you, till you decide,
But remember this, we won't hide.

We want to win, fair and square,
To be the one, with love and care,
So pick your presents, without strain,
But choose your groom, it's all in vain.

And hey girl, don't you worry,
We're all up to date, not like in a hurry,
We'll show you love, like never before,
And give you all, that and more.

Yo, Antinous spit a bar,
And all the others went far,
Sending their servants for gifts,
To give the goddess a lift.

Antinous came back with a dress of gold,
So exquisite, it had to be sold.
Eurymachus with a chain so bright,
It gleamed like the sun in its might.

Eurydamas's earrings were the talk of the night,
Three pendants sparkling with all their might.
Pisander gifted a necklace so rare,
It put all other gifts to despair.

Everyone else gave gifts so swell,
All to worship the goddess well.
And with that, the feast came to a close,
Everyone happy and full, with hearts in repose.

"Y'all suitors need to chill, don't you see?
The queen needs some space, just let her be.
She's got gifts to receive, and duties to do,
And y'all out here, singing like it's high school.
But I gotta say, your moves are kinda dope,
It's like watching TikToks, I almost lost hope.
Anyway, let's light up these braziers so bright,
And let the queen receive her gifts in the light.
And maids, I see y'all holding those torches like pros,
You're the real MVPs, that's how it goes."

Yo, maids of Ulysses, listen up quick,
Head inside and give the queen a kick,
Do some spinning, pick that wool,
And amuse her to banish any lull.

I'll hold the light, no need to worry,
Stay till morning, no need to hurry,
But don't try to beat me, I can stand the test,
Like a meme, I always come out best.

Yo, these maids are savage, laughing away
While pretty Melantho starts to play
Gibing at him, contemptuously at that
Doesn't she know it's not where it's at?

Daughter of Dolius, but Penelope raised
With toys and love, yet she's so unfazed
No care for her mistress, who's filled with sorrow
Misconducting with Eurymachus, like there's no tomorrow

Hold up, sis, why you gotta hate on my boy?
Talking trash 'bout him like he's just a useless toy?
Irus had it coming, he deserved the beat-down,
And my boy Odysseus wore that victory crown. 

But why you gotta talk like you're so above?
Can't you see this man's just spreading the love?
Maybe instead of judging like you're all high and mighty,
You could show some kindness and be a little bit more mighty.

And don't go acting like you're all that and a bag of chips,
With your fancy clothes and your wine on your lips.
We all know that you ain't too cool for school,
So don't act like you're too good to rule.

So cut the hate and the drama, it's time to move on,
And don't go thinking that you're the only one.
My boy Odysseus may be a poor wretch to you,
But to us he's a hero, through and through.

Oh snap, Ulysses ain't playing,
He's ready to start slaying.
This vixen's got some nerve,
But Ulysses won't observe.

He's about to spill the tea,
And make everyone see,
The lies that she's been spreading,
His anger is not forgetting.

Telemachus won't take this lightly,
Ulysses won't let her do this slightly.
She'll be torn apart like an emoji,
This is not a game, it's no Yoshi.

Ulysses is a hero, he's fierce and true,
This vixen doesn't stand a chance, boo.

Ulysses, our man, he stood tall,  
Near braziers burning, he had a ball.  
The women, they were shook,  
Thought they were in for a crook.  

But our hero held torches high,  
And looked intensely into the sky.  
He was pondering events to come,  
Waiting for them to strike and some.  

Ulysses was wise, he knew,  
That fate would unravel and come through.  
The women, they didn't have a clue,  
But he was ready, there was nothing new.  

Like a boss, he owned that space,  
Stood with poise, had a steady pace.  
Ulysses was definitely the man,  
No one could touch him, understand?

Y'all hear that trash talk, 
Eurymachus just made Ulysses the laughingstock. 
But Minerva ain't having any of that mess, 
She wants Ulysses to feel their disrespect, as she does confess. 

Eurymachus, son of Polybus, of course, 
Mocks Ulysses' baldness without remorse. 
But let me tell you something, it's clear as day, 
This man ain't just come here for no play. 

His mind is sharp, his cunning undeniable, 
He's got Penelope's heart, his love is un-untouchable. 
So don't be fooled by his lack of hair, 
This man is mighty, with nothing to despair. 

Minerva is on his side, that's a fact, 
So step off, you suitors, you're all wack. 
And don't forget, Ulysses is a beast, 
So run along now, before he unleashes his feast. 

Bet you didn't think I knew about this myth, 
But your girl here is well-read, and quite the whiz. 
So don't underestimate me, or Ulysses' plight, 
Or I might have to come after you with all my might.

Yo, listen up, stranger, the king does ask,
Will you work for pay, or is labor a task?
Stone fence, tree planting, all in his reel,
He'll provide your attire and a daily meal.

But Ulysses replied, "Nah, king, not me,
Don't want to work, gotta stay fly and free.
Beggin' on the streets, yeah that's my style,
Feelin' good with my belly full, mile by mile."

But the king was mad, didn't wanna hear,
Ulysses' words, thought they were insincere.
"You're just lazy, got bad ways," he spat,
"No job for you, get out of my chat."

Ay yo Eurymachus, it's time for some action, come let's give it a try, no need for distraction. Bring out the scythe, let's mow from dawn till dusk, and show who's the real boss, without any fuss. Or if you're all about that farming life, let's each take some tawny oxen, and plough with all our might. We'll see who can drive that straight furrow, and won't even have to borrow, any help or trick from the internet's echo. 

Now if it's war you want, then war you'll get, give me a shield, some spears, and the helmet that fits, and I'll lead the pack, with no turning back. Your insults and cruelty come from a place of insecurity, cause you're living your life in a world of obscurity. But when Ulysses comes back home, the doors are wide and free, but for you they'll be narrow, you'll struggle to flee, from the wrath of the king, who'll show you the meaning of being.

Eurymachus was raging, no telling what he'd do.
He accused Ulysses; said his words were untrue.
"Just because you defeated Irus in a fight,
Doesn't mean you can speak how you please tonight."
He grabbed a footstool with anger in his eyes,
But Ulysses hid behind Amphinomus, wise.
The stool hit the cupbearer, he fell to the ground,
The suitors were angry, chaos all around.
They wished the stranger would simply disappear,
Frowned amongst themselves, wishing the end was near.
"Why disturb us like this over a tramp?" they said,
"If he keeps it up, we'll have to give him the boot," was the dread.

Yo, what's good my homies, why ya actin' crazy?
Chill with the food and drinks, don't be so hazy.
I swear an evil spirit must be lurkin',
Let's all hit the sack before we start jerkin'. 

Telemachus, my dude, I feel you on this,
These old heads need to learn some bliss.
No need to argue or cause a big fight,
Just head home and sleep tight. 

I don't wanna be rude or cause any hate,
But your behavior right now is really not great.
So grab your stuff and say goodbye to the rest,
Go home and chillax, that's what's best.

The suitors thought he was extra,
His bold speech, they couldn't measure.
But Amphinomus, he was clever,
Said let's make no fuss, whatsoever.
No violence should come to play,
Let the drinks continue, go on your way.
As for the stranger, he's in T's house,
Let him deal with it, no need to rouse.

Yo, he spoke and it was rad,
His peeps were pleased and feeling glad,
Mulius mixed a drink with care,
Water and wine to share and bear.

Each man sipped from the bowl,
Their offerings to the gods, a goal,
They drank and drank, all merry,
And took their leave, not to tarry.

To each his own humble abode,
The way each man is surely showed,
Their paths they took, home straight,
Slept in their beds, dreaming fate.

I got you fam, don't be stressed,
I'll hype your story, no request denied or suppressed.

This is the tea we all crave,
Spill it out, don't be afraid.

Your story's fire, let's make it trend,
And blow up like a VSCO influencer friend.

You got the scoop, the deeds are sick,
I can't wait to share this to my clique.

We stan a good piece of drama,
Like Kim K and Kanye, that's a Bad Karma.

This story's so lit, it's like a meme,
Makes my heart race like a caffeine.

Like a TikTok, it's going viral,
And leaving us shook, it's so viral.

So let's get that clout and let it rain,
This story's hype, it's not quite monotone, but it's slayin'!

BOOK XIX

Yo, Ulysses was so shook,
He needed to find a way to get his weapons and armor to cook,
Telemachus listened while thinking 'bout the scheme,
And they both agreed to take it down, if you know what I mean.

He told Telemachus they had to be discreet,
Crafting an excuse that's not too neat,
Just say the armor was getting dirty,
And moving it down would avoid the flirty.

Telemachus, you gotta make it extra clear,
That with so much wine and time, things might turn queer,
They might fight and even do some harm,
And nobody wants that kind of charm.

If the suitors start to ask,
Telemachus, just give them a little task,
Tell them they're worrying about the soot,
And you're just trying to keep it cute.

With the help of Minerva, they'll get through,
And the suitors won't even have a clue,
Ulysses will be able to strike,
And make them feel the wrath of his spike.

Oh snap, Telemachus is on a mission.
He ain't playin', gotta handle the tradition.
He called up Euryclea, the nurse with the power,
Told her to corral the ladies and close the tower.

Telemachus wants that armor in pristine condition,
No smirches or soot, just a perfect rendition.
It's been neglected, no one cares for it now,
He'll stash it away safely in the store room, no how.

The maidens will stay put, can't be causing a scene,
While Telemachus handles things, he's got the lean mean gene.
His father would be proud, he's carrying on the legacy,
With Euryclea by his side, things'll be done easily.

Telemachus is the future, he's got it all deep,
So while he works on the armor, his fame will surely seep.

Aight, Euryclea, I hear you speakin'
But let me tell you, my plans ain't weakenin'
I'm ready to take charge of this house
And be the boss that everyone can arouse

But wait, who's gonna light up my path?
To the store room, I need someone to do the math
The maids wanna help, but they can't come along
Sorry, ladies, but this task is too strong

I need someone who's down to ride
And won't let anything get in their stride
So if you know a homie who's always lit
Tell them to come through, and we'll make a hit

As for the maids, they can take a seat
'Cause I am the one who's bringing the heat
Let's light up the way and get to the store
And show these goods what we're looking for

Yo, Telemachus is not one to play
If you wanna eat his bread, you better not just stay
He needs a light, a stranger must show
Earn your keep, from your head down to your toe
No matter where you're from, you gotta work for your plate
That's the rule, no debate 
Like they say in memes, "you gotta earn your keep"
Or it's goodbye to the bread, and no time to sleep

Oh my, Telemachus, what a sight!
These walls are shining oh so bright!
It's not just fire, oh no, my friend,
A god is here, that's what we can comprehend!

Minerva's here! Check out her golden light,
Bringing the shine, making things bright!
Father, let's get the gear inside,
Before we continue with our awesome stride.

Helmets, shields, and spears, oh my,
We'll get them all, I won't deny.
Minerva, please guide us through,
Your light is lit, we trust in you!

"Whoa, stop the drama, no need for vex,
Chill out and go get some rest,
Let me talk to the ladies, 
And don't you worry about the maybes.
Your mama will be asking questions, 
But I'll answer them all without objections."

Hey yo, Telemachus went to bed 
While Ulysses pondered, scheming in his head 
He wanted those suitors dead, oh so bad 
And with Minerva's help, he wouldn't be sad

Ulysses knew what had to be done
He couldn't let those suitors have any fun
He had to kill them, one by one 
And make sure they knew he had won

With Minerva's power, he could succeed
And show those suitors they couldn't proceed 
Ulysses was ready, he had a plan 
It was time to take a stand

So watch out suitors, Ulysses is coming 
And he's not here for any sweet nothings 
He's here to take back what is his 
And leave you all in utter dis    may.

Yo Penelope strutted down, looking like a queen,
A seat for her was set, it was truly pristine.
Icmalius made it, with silver and ivory,
A fleece covered it, so her seat was cozy.

Her seat by the fire, where she always sat,
The maids joined her, to gossip and chat.
They cleared the tables, where the suitors were savage,
And took cups and bread, making a cleanup damage.

The braziers were emptied, full of embers bright,
Wood was thrown upon them, to give warmth and light.
But Melantho spoke up, feeling quite bold,
"Get out, stranger, or we'll leave you out in the cold."

Ulysses stood his ground, he didn't flinch,
Yo Melantho, you need to give up that inch.
He was calm but firm, he wouldn't leave so easily,
Ulysses wasn't going to back down measly.

Hold up, this woman's getting heated,
But Ulysses, he ain't defeated,
He used to live the high life, you see,
But now he begs on bended knee.

Don't be acting like you're above,
'Cause you could end up like him, love,
Jove took everything, left him with rags,
And now he's just another tramp who begs.

So, beware, pride comes before a fall,
You might lose it all, and that's not all,
Ulysses could come back, don't you know?
And his son, Telemachus, ain't no fool to show.

So, don't mess around with the maids in the house,
Or they'll get in trouble with Telemachus, the mouse,
And even though Ulysses might be gone,
His legacy still shines on. #StayHumble #TelemachusRocks #UlyssesWho

Oh snap, Penelope came in hot,
Is that a maid, or a thot?
Talking back like she's got the power,
But she's 'bout to meet Penelope's tower.

"I see your behavior is abominable,
Better watch out or you'll be quite audible,"
Said Penelope, getting all riled up,
While the maid tries to back out of her mess-up.

Penelope's husband is gone, it's true,
And she's feeling sad, just like me and you,
But she's not taking disrespect from a maid,
She's got too much pride, too much shade.

So listen, y'all, and heed Penelope's words,
Or else you'll be like that maid, like a bunch of nerds.
No need to act rude, just show some respect,
Or you'll be getting a talking-to, let me reflect.

Oh my days, did you hear that?

Queen Penelope wants to chat

She needs a seat with a fleece

So the visitor can feel at ease

Eurynome was tasked with the job

To bring the seat and not to sob

The stranger had a story to tell

And Penelope wanted to listen well

Yo, Penelope, you're lookin' fly
Asking questions, wonderin' why
Who I be and where I'm from
Let me tell you, it won't take long

I'm a stranger, that's for sure
But my story, it's quite pure
My town is one you may not know
But it's where I was raised and where I grow

My parents, they were kind and true
Raised me right, taught me what to do
But now I'm here, so far from home
Just a wanderer, all alone

But enough about me, Penelope dear
Let's talk about you, so don't you fear
How you've waited for years on end
For your man, your heart, and your best friend

Yo, Ulysses spitting straight fire,
Madam, there's nobody higher.
With fame that reaches the stars,
You're like a king without the cars.

You uphold righteousness like a boss,
Your people do good deeds, no loss.
The earth yields grain and fruit so rare,
Your reign is oh-so-fair.

But listen, I'm here in your crib,
Don't ask about my race, don't rib.
My memories hurt, my heart's sad,
Can't sit here crying, it's just bad.

One of your servants might catch me,
Eyes filled with tears, brewing like tea.
Thinking I'm drunk, can't hold my liquor,
But really, it's just my emotions that flicker.

Aye, Penelope, I hear your plight
Your suitors give you so much fright
You're skilled in needlework, that's great
But these guys, they just won't wait

Your heart is heavy, we understand
The pressure from your parents is out of hand
Your son is noble, that's for sure
But it's time to find a husband, you can't ignore

But hold up, wait a minute, who am I?
I'm your cool assistant, here to supply
Some hype and cheer, some modern flair
To your tales of woe, Penelope, dear

Tell me, where you from, what's your story
Are you a queen, or is that allegory?
Father and mother, you certainly had
But I bet they weren't as lit as, say, Drake's dad

So spill the tea, let's hear the scoop
We're here for you, let us be the group
To lift you up, and keep you strong
Through all the hardships, all the wrongs.

Yo, listen up, madam, this is Aethon speakin',
I'll answer your questions, even if it's grievin'.
As an exile, I've wandered far and wide,
Suffering among peoples, feeling all the vibes.

There's an isle called Crete, it's fresh and fair,
With nine cities and people speakin' everywhere.
Achaeans, Eteocretans, Dorians too,
And Pelasgi nobles, all coexistin' in view.

In the great town of Cnossus, Minos reigned supreme,
Sippin' tea with Jove every nine years like a dream.
Deucalion was his son, who had two children in his stead,
Idomeneus and myself, Aethon, the name by which I'm led.

My bro set sail for Troy, brave and bold,
While I stayed in Crete, hospitable and told,
Of the time when winds took Ulysses off course,
Leavin' him stranded in Amnisus without recourse.

I helped him out by showin' him hospitality,
Feedin' him and his crew with abundant vitality.
They stayed with me for twelve days without haste,
Givin' thanks for oxen, wine, and barley meal at a feast.

The North wind blew strong makin' it hard to stand,
Perhaps some unfriendly god had it planned.
But on the thirteenth day, the wind finally ceased,
And Ulysses and his men were finally released.

Yo welcome, Penelope, to the modern age,
I'll hype up your story like your hubby on the center stage.
Ulysses, that man was wicked clever,
His tales, they'll make your heart break forever.

As he spoke, your tears fell like rivers overflowing,
Melting your cheeks like snow, yo it was mind-blowing.
But Ulysses held his gaze, his eyes as hard as iron,
With tears he restrained, his strength left you admiring.

Now to put him to the test, you do desire,
To see if his tales are just a liar.
Describe to you the look of your man,
And his companions, let's see if he can.

Penelope, Ulysses knows your man well,
Yo, he was dressed like a hero, no need to dwell.
Brave and strong, with a fierce look in his eye,
His companions are legends, no need to lie.

So, Penelope, hope this hypes up your story,
Your man is a king, yo, he's got all the glory.

Oh snap, you ask about Ulysses,
It's been twenty years, tryna remember gives me stress.
But listen up, I'll try my best,
To describe his outfit and put your mind at rest.

His mantle was purple, double lined real neat,
Fastened with a gold brooch, made his outfit complete.
The brooch showed a dog holding a fawn, 
Strangling it to death like some scene from a lawn.

And when it caught the sunlight, it shone so bright,
All the ladies were in awe at the sight.
His shirt was soft and hugged him tight, 
Fitted like the skin of an onion, that's just right. 

I don't know if he wore this gear on his departure,
Perhaps a friend gifted it for his adventure.
I gave him a sword of bronze, purple mantle all fine, 
Sent him off with respect for the man of his mind.

His servant Eurybates, was always by his side,
Hunched shoulders, dark skin, and curly hair so wide.
Ulysses treated him like a kin,
True friends till the end, they always win. 

So there you have it, my memory lane,
Ulysses outfit, I hope you're entertained.

Penelope, girl you got me in my feels
Ulysses gone, now your heart it reels
He brought you proof that he was your man
And you were moved by his master plan

You gave him clothes, a brooch so gold
His journey's end, so harsh and cold
You feel such pity for this poor stranger
And vow to welcome him like no other ranger

Oh fate be cruel, his journey bleak
The city he went to, you cannot even speak
But fear not, Penelope, this too shall pass
Your kindness shines bright, like a diamond glass.

Yo, madam, stop the tears and the cries,
I swear on my life, I'm not telling lies;
Ulysses, your husband, is still alive,
He's traveling home and on a path to thrive.

He's among the Thesprotians, getting treasures,
From one and another, with so much pleasure;
His men, though, brought their own demise,
And drowned on the way back, to everyone's surprise.

But Ulysses, oh Ulysses, a wily one he is,
He clung on to the keel and didn't miss,
The shores of Phaecia, where immortals roam,
Who treated him like a king, and made his journey their own.

Even if he'd come back earlier, he wouldn't stay,
He's a clever man, with a mind that plays,
He's gathering riches from lands far away,
And soon you'll see him here, without delay.

Now I swear on Jove, the first among gods,
And the hearth of Ulysses, who we all applaud,
That my words are true and will come to be,
Ulysses will return, you'll see, you'll see.

Penelope spoke with much grace and cheer,
but my heart sank as I drew near,
For I could see her doubt and fear.

"If Ulysses comes back," she said with hope,
"He'll gift you high and nope, nope, nope,
there ain't no one as great, don't be a dope."

I took in her words, but felt the strain
For Ulysses is gone, it's not the same,
Master's missing, what a great shame.

"Hey maids, help me out," I said,
"Give me a hand, I need my feet fed,
After that, I need a comfortable bed."

Her kindness moved me, I had to concede,
So I got washed up and sat down to feed,
And joy filled my heart that's long been in need.

Penelope's heart and wisdom is true,
She sits high above, that is her due,
Blessed is she - that's the truth, plain and blue.

Yo, Madam, I been roaming
Through rough sleeping places, never loafing
I don't need no blankets or rugs to cover
Been there, done that, that game is over

I've spent sleepless nights waiting for morning
With no soft bed, not even a cushion
I don't need any young hussies to touch my feet
But if there's an old woman with a story to beat

I'll let her wash them, I won't be fussy
As long as she's respectable, no young and sassy
I'm Ulysses, with a story to tell
Of my journey through hell, and how I broke the spell

So let me rest, and let me be
For my journey has been long, as you can see
Let my feet be washed by someone wise
And I'll continue my journey, under the skies

Yo Penelope, your words sound so acute,
Your guest's got some great manners, that's the truth.
In your crib, there's an elderly dame so kind,
Who nursed your hubby back when he was just a find.

Euryclea, that's the name of the old dame,
Who shall come and wash your guest's feet without any shame,
Even though she's weak, she'll take on this task,
For hospitality's a forte that she will not mask.

I bet you're thinking, his feet might totally smell,
Especially if this journey put him through hell,
But no worries my dear, you nailed it right,
Age slows us down and gives us quite the fight.

In short, your guest will be treated so well,
He'll leave your crib feeling ultra swell,
Now let's end this tale with a meme so dank,
"Livin' like Larry" is the phrase we'll bank.

Oh my dear, don't you cry,
I'll help you, just give me a try.
Your god-fearing heart's pure as gold,
But Jove's actions are just plain cold.

You gave him so many offerings and praise,
Yet he's trapped you in these unknown ways.
You prayed to see your son and grow old,
But now you're left here out in the cold.

Those foreign palace ladies must be so rude,
Gibing at you, that's just plain crude.
I get why you don't want their touch,
But I'll wash your feet, I love you so much.

Let me shout out something Penelope said,
You got me feeling compassion, that's no fib.
We've seen all kinds of people in distress,
But none like you, no, you're the best.

Your voice, your feet, your figure, too,
All match Ulysses' in every view.
Don't worry, old woman, dry those eyes,
Together we'll make a plan, no goodbyes.

Oh my squad, you won't believe,
What Ulysses said, it's like a heist, so thieve,
He said our likeness is on point, 
And I'm not going to lie, that's lit, no disappoint!
Everybody who's seen us together,
Says we look twin-like, is that whatevah?
I know what you're thinking, OMG,
But it's true, believe it hunny!

Okay, okay, let me tell you what went down,
Ulysses was chillin' by the fire, hangin' 'round,
His feet were in need of a good ol' wash,
So the old woman got a cauldron, it was quite posh.

She filled it with water, hot and cold,
And Ulysses got anxious, truth be told,
For he had a scar that gave him away,
And the old woman would notice without delay.

That scar was from the mighty boar,
Who attacked him once while he did explore,
With his grandpa Autolycus, what a guy,
The most skilled thief, willing to cheat and lie.

Mercury blessed Ulysses with this mark,
He'd burn animal bones in the dark,
And grant his buds a gift so rare,
To seek his company, they'd even dare.

Autolycus, Ulysses' grandpa so fly,
Went to Ithaca, and saw with his eye,
His daughter's newborn baby boy,
And said "Let's give him a name that brings joy."

After supper, the baby was placed,
On Autolycus' knees, he sat with grace,
And Euryclea said "Yo, you gotta name him now,
You've been wishin' for a grandkid, take a bow."

"Yo, Autolycus, that's quite a diss,
Naming your granddaughter 'Ulysses'
But no hate to your style, it's fly,
You're really on that name game high!

So when this kid goes on her trip,
She'll get a present, that's the tip
And she'll go home feeling so lit,
With a smile on her face that won't quit.

I'm sure that when she's grown,
She'll have a life that's fully blown
And maybe then she'll make her home,
On Mount Parnassus where she can roam.

Thanks for sharing your fam story,
It's filled with love and legacy, so smarty,
And now we'll always remember the glory,
Of this child named Ulysses, so hearty!"

Yo, Ulysses, my dude, went to Parnassus,
To get some gifts from Autolycus, no fuss.
His grandma, Amphithea, was full of affection,
Givin' him hugs and kisses with no objection.

Autolycus and his sons were more than delighted,
A five year old bull was brought in, fully sighted.
They flayed, cut up, and roasted it right,
So everyone could feast until night.

From sunrise to sunset, the food was lit,
All bellies were full, no one was throwin' a fit.
When the sun went down and it was dark outside,
They hit the hay, and enjoyed a peaceful vibe. 

Now that's the end of this ancient tale,
Maybe next time, they'll cook and feast with kale.

Dawn's child appeared with fingers all rosy,
Ulysses went hunting with hounds that were nosy.
On Parnassus' wooded slopes they did climb,
Soon reaching valleys that were breezy and fine.

The sun began to beat upon the fields,
Fresh-risen from Oceanus' slow still yields.
The boar heard their noise and came out to play,
Raising his bristles with fire in his gaze.

Ulysses raised his spear, oh so quick,
But the boar charged sideways, what a slick trick!
The brute ripped him above his strong knee,
A gash so deep, but not enough to reach the bone, you see.

Ulysses didn't give up, he hit that boar,
The spear was aimed perfectly, left the monster on the floor.
The brothers of Autolycus tended to Ulysses' deep cut,
Said a spell to stop the bleeding, then away they strut.

Autolycus and his sons showered with gifts galore,
They sent Ulysses on his journey home with much to adore.
Back in Ithaca, his parents were thrilled to see,
Their son's return with a story so lively.

They asked him all about it, how he got that scar,
Ulysses told them of his hunt, and that he had gone too far.

Oh my gosh, no way, are you for real?
Euryclea just recognized Ulysses, what a big deal!
She held his scarred limb and her eyes welled up with tears,
All of her joy and grief pouring out, it was clear. 

She dropped the foot and it hit the ground, 
The water all spilled, what a mess she found! 
Euryclea grabbed Ulysses' beard so tight,
She could hardly talk, what a crazy sight. 

"My dear child, I know it must be true,
You're Ulysses himself, I had no clue!
I had to touch and handle you to believe,
My mind is blown, I can hardly breathe!"

Yo, Ulysses at long last is back,
But Euryclea's giving him some flack
Instead of keeping her lips zipped tight,
She wants to shout it to the house with all her might.

But Ulysses ain't having none of that,
He grips her throat and pulls her flat
He tells her straight with no remorse,
If she tells anyone, he'll take no divorce.

She nursed him when he was just a lad,
But now her talk is making Ulysses mad
He's come to take back his rightful place,
And rid the house of each suitor's face.

So Euryclea, please hush it up,
Ulysses ain't playing, he's fed up
He's back to take what's his by right,
And send the suitors on their last good night.

"Yo, Euryclea, you're a queen, 
you keep it cool, you keep it clean.
No one can break you, no one can bend, 
Your strength is lit, it's on-trend.

When the suitors are delivered to your fate, 
you'll give a list we can appreciate.
Of women ill-behaved and those who are pure,
and we'll handle them, that's for sure.

Your tongue's like iron, it won't blab, 
and we'll handle the haters, like a viral dab." #savage #loyal #girlpower

Oh snap, Ulysses ain't having it with Nurse,
He knows how to form his own opinions, no curse.
He's telling her to hold her tongue,
And leave it up to heaven, it won't be long.

He's a boss, he's got this on lock,
He doesn't need any negativity to clock.
Ulysses is a king, a hero for days,
Oh, and don't forget that Nurse, he's got major sway.

He's got faith and trust in the powers above,
No need to worry, he's got it covered like a glove.
So let's all take a cue from the man Ulysses,
And leave our worries up to fate and its processes. 

But that doesn't mean we can't make it lit,
Like our favorite meme "it is what it is," a hit. 
So keep on slaying, keep being true,
And always remember, you do you!

"Yo, stranger, your story's got me hooked,
But tell me now, have you ever looked
Upon my husband, brave and true?
Tell me, have you met him too?"

Ulysses replied with cunning grace,
"Your hubby and I, we spent some days
In Troy, where we fought and bled,
And Homer wrote about what we did."

Penelope's eyes grew wide with surprise,
"The fabled hero before my eyes?
Oh, how I long to see him again,
But alas, his fate remains a great pain."

Ulysses' heart was filled with glee,
As he knew his plan was about to be,
"Penelope, fear not, for he will return,
And then your heart will forever burn,
With love and joy, once again,
For the king of Ithaca, my friend."

And with that, he melted into the night,
Leaving Penelope with a glimmer of light,
Filled with hope and ecstasy,
Thanks to Ulysses, the man with strategy.

Yo stranger, let's talk real quick,
I'm strugglin' to sleep, it's making me sick.
My life's full of woe, it's like a curse,
I can't stop weeping, it's getting worse.

During the day I'm busy with work,
But even then, my heart is berserk.
At night it's even worse, I can't cope,
My heart is broken, it feels like rope.

My mind is like a nightingale's song,
A tragic tale, that's been too long.
Should I stay with my son, and be grand,
Or go with the suitors, who want my hand?

My son is begging me to go,
The suitors are causing us sorrow.
Then I had a dream, It's making me wonder,
And I'm hoping for your help to ponder.

Twenty geese, my most prized love
Were killed by an eagle from above,
He dug his beak into their necks,
And left them all, it was a wreck.

I cried and cried, until my maidens came,
And tried to comfort my heart full of pain.
But the eagle came back, this time with words,
Telling me this isn't over, but for the birds.

The geese are the suitors, he did say,
And he's really my husband in every way.
He's returning to fix things for me,
And put the suitors in their place, you'll see.

Oh, snap, Ulysses! 
You're spittin' fire so ruthless! 
Your dream interpretation is on fleek,
All the suitors will get wrecked, they're so weak!
They won't survive and they won't thrive,
Sorry not sorry, they didn't survive!
Your prophecy is so lit, Ulysses,
The suitors better run for their distresses!
It's like Drake said, "I'm upset,"
The suitors won't know what hit them yet!

Okay, so Penelope spun a tale
About dreams that could make you pale
There are two gates through which they come 
One selfish and one just for fun 

Ivory gates take you away
From reality, they make you sway
But the horns one, that's the real deal
A clear message it can reveal 

Penelope's dream, she can't be sure
If it's fake or it will be the cure 
A tournament of axes is the game
Suitors all want to win that fame 

Twelve axes waiting in a row 
Like a ship they stand, each an arrow's foe 
The suitor who can make the shot
Will win her hand, or so Penelope thought 

The dawn will bring a day so tough 
One that will cut her breath and rough 
From Ulysses' house she'll have to go
Her heart so heavy, her soul so low 

But hey, it's nothing but a dream 
Or maybe something that makes us scream
We'll have to wait and see what's true 
Until the dawn reveals the suitor who 

Can shoot that arrow straight and far 
And win Penelope's heart, Oh la la!

Okay, listen up queen, don't be mean,
Ulysses will come through, it's as if it's in his gene.
Don't defer the game, it won't be lame,
He'll beat the suitors at their own game.

You don't need to wait, Ulysses is great,
He'll string the bow, it's his noble trait.
He'll shoot those arrows, strong like a sparrow,
The iron won't stand a chance, it's time to throw.

So don't you worry, don't you fret,
Ulysses is coming, you can bet.
He'll take on the suitors, they'll regret,
Thinking they could beat him, but they met their sunset.

And if they try to mess around,
Ulysses will knock them to the ground.
He's the king, the boss, the man renowned,
With him around, victory is bound.

Yo girl, you gotta get some rest,
Even though I know you're quite oppressed,
By the thought of missing out on chat,
But Penelope, you can't do that.

You've gotta recharge for tomorrow,
So don't be consumed by your sorrow,
You can lay down on that couch and weep,
And maybe catch up on some sleep.

Ulysses, he's been gone a while,
But girl you got that Greek style,
You're strong, you're fierce, you're independent,
And your mind is sharp, it's never hesitant.

So go on, queen, give in to the night,
And dream of future battles you'll fight,
For when the morning sun does rise,
You'll be ready to conquer, you'll be wise.

And hey, when you wake up anew,
We'll chat some more, just me and you,
So don't worry, don't feel blue,
As long as there's wifi, we'll see it through.

#StayFierceQueen #SleepIsImportant #PenelopeTheGreekGoddess

She's feeling blue, in her room all alone,
With her maidens nearby, to them she's grown.
She laments her husband, dear and kind,
But Minerva steps in, sleep she'll find.

Sweet dreams ahead, her eyelids now close,
But will she remember any of those?
Or will she wake with a start in a while,
And feel her heart burst with tears and her smile?

Minerva's gift is a mercurial one,
Not always constant or easily done.
But tonight she's blessed, it seems to be,
So sleep well, dear Queen, sweet dreams, zzz. 😴

Yooo wassup, party people in the house?
Got a story for y'all, it's gonna make you shout!
It's got drama, it's got spice,
And it's definitely worth the price (which is free, by the way).

So, check it out, this girl, she's a real Queen B,
And she's always causing drama, like the reality TV.
She had beef with this dude, I think his name was Chad,
And things were getting heated, oh boy, it was bad.

They were throwing shade left and right,
Like a couple of catty mean girls in a fight,
But then, out of nowhere, came a plot twist,
And suddenly, their feud was dismissed.

Turns out, they had been dating all along,
Like, whoa, that's some crazy love song.
They went from enemies to lovers, like a modern-day Romeo and Juliet,
And all of us were like, "OMG, we didn't expect that!"

So, moral of the story, don't judge a book by its cover,
You never know what's hidden under the lover.
And always keep an open mind and heart,
Like the internet says, "let's vibe and never fall apart!"

BOOK XX

Yo, Ulysses was chillin' on a cowhide,
Thinkin' bout how to take the suitors for a ride,
He covered himself with sheepskins, warm and snuggly,
And Eurynome threw a cloak, making him extra comfy.

But then, the ladies who had been messin' around,
Came out the house all giggly with sounds,
This made Ulysses seriously livid,
Thinking 'bout killin' all of them, he was wicked.

His heart growled like a mama dog with pups,
Showin' his teeth like a boss, he didn't give up,
But he calmed himself, beat his chest like a king,
Remembered when the Cyclops ate his friends like a swing.

"Stay cool, heart, you've been through worse," he said,
Recallin' how he used his cunning and led,
His crew out of the Cyclops' lair,
Ulysses knew, he had to be wise and fair.

Yo homie, why you staying up so late? 
In your own crib, with your family safe and great 
I see you tossing and turning, thinking of how to slay 
Those wicked suitors, so they won’t come and play 

But hold up, my dude, don’t forget who you are 
A warrior so strong, like a shooting star 
And plus, you got a goddess on your side 
Minerva’s here to help you turn the tide 

She’s chillin’ up there in disguise 
Watching over you with her all-knowing eyes 
So don’t you fret, don’t you worry, don’t you fear 
With her guidance, victory will soon be near 

Head to bed now, get some rest 
Sleep well, my bro, you’re truly blessed 
Wake up tomorrow, with a fresh new start 
And let the goddess guide you with her mighty heart

Aye, Odysseus, I hear your plight,
trying to take out the suitors, a rough fight.
The numbers are high, it's no surprise,
but with our help you'll cut them down to size.

Don't worry, man, we've got your back,
your enemies will fall, that's a fact.
But after the dust settles and the fight's done,
you're concerned about where to run.

Haters gonna hate, they'll be out for blood,
you gotta have a plan to escape their cud.
We'll figure it out, don't have a doubt,
just trust in us, we'll help you sprout.

So let's get to work and make a scheme,
together we'll make the suitors scream.
G-Unit out! (I had to throw that in,)
let's make sure these guys don't win.

Oh my goddess, Minerva, you're like a rich tea,
Protecting old mates like in ancient history.
You're like a superhero, but no Wonder Woman,
And if there's danger lurking, you're the one to summon.

Listen, mortals can be dumb, I'm speaking out,
But Minerva's wise, you gotta give a shout-out,
She's always got your back, through thick and thin,
So trust her, friend, and you're sure to win.

Let's say there's 50 bands, with some real big guns,
Don't fear, Minerva's got us covered, no need to run.
We'll take their sheep and cattle, and make it rain,
And by sunrise, we'll be far from any pain.

But now it's time to hit the hay,
You don't wanna toss and turn, it's just not OK.
So catch some Z's, and you'll be fine,
Thanks to Minerva, your goddess divine.

She bounced back to Olympus with a snap,
And left him there, snoozin', taking a nap.
But before she left, she cast a spell,
A deep slumber on this mortal fella.

Her voice flowed like a river, oh so divine,
And he drifted off, as if watching vines.
But now he dreams, in a world all his own,
With the gods and heroes, all widely known.

Even though he's just a mere mortal guy,
He'll explore the universe, sparkin' joy.
Thanks to the goddess from above,
He'll slumber soundly, enveloped in love.

Just like the meme that's oh so great,
Sleepy time tea will seal his fate.
And when he wakes, he'll feel brand new,
Ready to tackle whatever life throws, out of the blue.

Oh man, Ulysses was in a slumber so deep,
His wife woke up and started to weep.
She prayed to Diana, asked for relief,
Wished for an arrow to cause her grief.

She wanted to disappear from mortal sight,
And be hidden from everyone's light.
Just like the daughters of Pandareus,
Who were taken away, away from all of us.

Venus took care of them, taught them well,
So they could thrive, and not simply dwell.
Juno bestowed upon them beauty and grace,
While Minerva gave them plenty of ace.

But Venus was gone when the winds took them far,
And made them into servants of Erinyes, who mar.
She just wished to disappear,
Away from everything, away from the fear.

She couldn't close her eyes, couldn't sleep,
Her misery followed, misery that's deep.
She had a dream that Ulysses was there,
But woke up to emptiness, it didn't seem fair.

Ulysses heard her cry the weep,
he couldn't help but wonder as he did sleep
the voice sounded so familiar, it was hard to keep

He got up from his resting pile,
took the cloak and led with a smile,
in the courtyard, he kept it in style.

He went outside to make a prayer,
to Father Jove, that he might hear,
he asked for another sign to steer.

He wanted to hear the voice of another,
someone else who lived with his mother,
and guide him back to his home like a brother.

Ulysses listens to the wind and the sound,
unleashed his inner self is something he found,
to hope a sign would get him homeward bound.

Yo, Ulysses prayed up high,
And Jove heard him with a thunderous reply,
Up on Olympus, the heavens did roar,
Ulysses knew that it meant something more.

Inside the mill, a woman did shout,
Giving a sign, Ulysses had no doubt,
Twelve women to grind wheat and barley,
This one left, the rest in the barley.

Weak and tired, she cried out to Jove,
"End their feasts, let this be the last grove,"
Father Jove, king of earth and sky,
Please end their dinners, don't let them get by.

These suitors have used me up,
With their constant mealtime erupts,
Please, Jove, let this be the last,
So I can grind in peace, without past.

Ulysses knew that now was his time,
To take back what was rightfully mine,
Jove had heard his cry, and so did she,
The miller-woman who just wanted to be free.

With Jove on his side, Ulysses can rest,
Knowing the end of their feast is the best,
No more grinding, just peace in his home,
Until his final victory is fully grown.

Oh my gosh, Ulysses is the man,
He's finally coming up with a plan.
He heard the omens, he got a clue,
And now he knows what he's gotta do.

The thunder boomed loud and clear,
And Ulysses knew he had nothing to fear.
The woman's speech gave him a beat,
And now it's time to take a seat.

The suitors think they've got it all,
But Ulysses is about to make them fall.
They all think they're gonna win,
But Ulysses is about to give them a spin.

He's got a trick up his sleeve,
And the suitors won't even believe,
What's about to go down,
They're about to look like a bunch of clowns.

Ulysses is gonna take back control,
And the suitors won't have any role.
He's got his confidence and his might,
And he's gonna put up a fight.

So watch out suitors, Ulysses is here,
And he's not gonna disappear.
He's got his eyes on the prize,
And he won't compromise.

As the fire blazed bright and the maids awoke, Telemachus dressed up- no joke.
He strapped his sword and put on his kicks, 
also readying a spear with deadly pricks.
Telemachus walked out, talking to Euryclea, "Did you show hospitality to the stranger, or leave him alone to be a lone ranger?
My mom's kinda funny, she treats some folks so special, but ignores the ones who are truly beneficial."

"Yo, don't pass the blame on the stranger," said Euryclea with no anger. "He sat and drank his wine with no distraction, your mom offered him more bread without any hesitation. He declined, no need for negotiation. When he wanted to sleep, she offered the best, but he declined with a solid protest. He preferred a bullock hide and sheepskins, giving him comfort so divine. A cloak I threw to make sure he'll be fine."

As Telemachus walked, his two dogs by his side
Euryclea called the maids, their duties to abide
"Sprinkle the water, sweep the cloisters with care
Cover the seats and tables, do it with flair!
Get the cups and jugs, and make them gleam bright
Fill them with water, quick, with all your might!
The suitors will arrive, it's a feast day, oh my
They'll be here early like a bird in the sky!"

As the women went for water, 
The men began chores like they oughta'. 
Firewood was chopped and pigs set free, 
But Ulysses was wondering, just like me. 

The swineherd asked with a grin, 
If they were still acting like they would win. 
"Are they being mean or treating you well?" 
He asked Ulysses, hoping he could tell. 

The suitors had been quite rude, 
But now they were starting to include 
The stranger in their daily routine, 
Though they still thought they could be king and queen. 

Ulysses watched as they chopped and carried, 
Thinking of how they could soon be buried. 
But for now, he played the role of a guest, 
Waiting for the perfect moment to be the best. 

As the swineherd went to tend the pigs, 
Ulysses knew that he had to dig. 
Deeper into their plans he must go, 
To ensure their ultimate overthrow.

Yo, Ulysses, you savage and wise,
I feel you, dawg, with those guys.
They deal so wicked, high and proud,
Without a sense of shame screaming loud.

Their lack of manners is straight-up bogus,
Creeping through houses like some janky Smokey Bear hocus pocus.
May heaven send them their wrath,
And give them what's coming on their path.

As Melanthius came through,
Bringing goats with his crew,
He saw Ulysses and said "Hey,
What are you still doing here anyway?
Begging without any shame,
Can't you go somewhere else to play this game?
Why don't we settle this score,
And give each other a taste of our fists, and more?
Plenty of feasts with the Achaeans around,
Why stick here and keep getting turned down?"

Philoetius pulled up real slow
Asked the Swineherd 'bout the new bro
"Where's he from? Is he a king?
This man looks like he's seen some things"
The Swineherd shook his head, no reply
But Ulysses sat still, didn't deny
Philoetius, with his goats and cow,
Made sure they were safe, and took a vow
To find out who this stranger be
And if he's got a place in their family tree.

Yo, this dude walks up to Ulysses like "what's poppin', my guy?"
Saying he hopes he'll have better times, but that's a big lie
He calls out to Father Jove, the most malicious god, and why?
'Cause he's feeling down and thinks Ulysses is living a lie
He's in rags just like this man, and that brings a tear to his eye
He says Ulysses might be dead or in the house of Hades, it's not a lie
He was his stockman, took care of his cattle, and they multiplied like pie
But now, they're getting eaten by others who don't even try
To show mercy to his son who's alive, and it's making him fly
Off the handle, he wants to flee with the cattle, and why?
It's too hard to stay and watch them get taken while he's living a lie
His situation is intolerable, but he's holding out for the guy
He believes Ulysses will return and make all the suitors say bye-bye.

"Oh dang, Ulysses, you speakin' the truth,
Swearing to the gods, no need for proof,
I can see you're legit, smart and all,
But you've got a challenge, I'll break the fourth wall.

You gotta take down the suitors, they're in your way,
But don't worry homie, you'll conquer, slay,
I bet ya'll thinkin', 'bout time to flex,
Ulysses will come back, and make them vex.

And like they say, 'It's on like Donkey Kong,'
Ulysses will take 'em down, all day long,
So keep your head up, don't stress or fret,
Ulysses will be back, you can bet your net."

Oh man, if Jove made it go down,
I'd be ready to help, no time to clown.
I'll go in hard, won't stop with the toil,
Like a legend, I'll work my soil.

No cap, I'll do my utmost best,
Won't take a break until there's no more quest.
I'm down for the cause, no room for quitting,
Got my head in the game, no room for sitting.

Like that Drake meme, I'll be there,
Helping out without any care.
You can count on me to do it right,
Even in the dark, I'll shine light.

So let's get it, no time for waiting,
The task at hand has me anticipating. 
I'll grind hard and bring success fast,
Just call on me and I'll be there, no questions asked.

Yo yo yo, Eumaeus was praying for a happy ending,
Hoping Ulysses would finally be back, no more pretending.
He hoped the gods would hear his prayer,
And bring Ulysses back in their care.

Eumaeus' heart was full of hope,
He knew Ulysses was tough as a rope.
He prayed to the gods with all his might,
Hoping Ulysses would return and make everything right.

Like a boss, he prayed with all his energy,
Hoping Ulysses would come back with his synergy.
He wanted his friend to finally come back,
And bring an end to his long, painful track. 

Eumaeus knew his friend was missed,
And he wanted him back, no more dismissed.
He prayed for his homecoming day,
And hoped that the gods would show him the way. 

So let's hype it up, let's get it hype,
Ulysses is coming back, that's not a type!
Eumaeus' prayers will be answered soon,
And we'll all be howling at the moon!

Oh snap, the suitors were up to no good
Plotting to murder Telemachus, which ain't cool in my 'hood
But then, from out of the blue
An eagle with a dove, flew into view 
And Amphinomus, in his wisdom, said 
"Let's chill and go eat instead, let's put murder to bed"

Oh my gosh, they went inside and spread out,
Laid their cloaks down, no need to pout.
They sacrificed the sheep, goats, and pigs,
And drank wine, dancing jigs.
Philoetius gave everyone a piece of bread,
While Melanthius poured wine to fill their heads.
They put their hands on the food divine,
What a feast, a meal so fine!

Hey yo, check it out, yo, Telemachus the man,
Making moves, putting Ulysses in the plan,
A shabby seat, but with wine in a gold cup,
Sipping with class, while the suitors act up.

This ain't no public house, this belongs to Ulysses,
Telemachus taking charge, miss him with the nonsense,
He's got the meats, the wine, and the power,
Suitors better back off, before things turn sour.

No gibes or blows in this homey abode,
Telemachus knows how to lighten the load,
So suitors, keep your hands and tongues in check,
Or else you'll find yourselves in quite the wreck. 

Telemachus is the man who's got the plan,
Keeping things cool with a drink in his hand,
Showing everyone who's boss in this place,
And the suitors better recognize, or they'll fall from grace.

Yo, Antinous, hold up, you're like a clown
Trying to shut down Telemachus, throwing shade all around
But he's not scared, he's speaking his mind
And you know it, that's why his boldness you can't unwind

Your squad's weak, not ready for a real fight
If Jove had let you, you still wouldn't have the might
To stop Telemachus, he's got courage for days
So listen up, you're just a bunch of disarrayed strays

Hold up, hold up, let me tell ya a story
'Bout some dudes and their quest for glory
Telemachus was the name of the son
Of Odysseus, the king who was gone

Antinous spoke, but Telemachus was chill
Just livin' life, not thinking it's a big deal
Heralds were bringing a holy hecatomb
Ain't no party like a Greek party, hot damn!

The Achaeans were gathered under Apollo's tree
Getting lit and vibin', just like you and me
No worries, just friends and some shady shade 
Chilling together until the sunlight fade.

Oh dang, they cooked up a feast so shiny,
Roasting meat to taste so tasty and fine-y.
Ulysses got the same portion as the rest,
Telemachus made sure, he was impressed.

The waiters listened to what the boss said,
They hooked Ulysses up, filled his plate, no shred.
In this banquet, they all had a seat,
And the food was lit, it couldn't be beat.

Just like a meme that's trending online,
This feast was epic, one of a kind.
Food that looked so good, it cannot be missed,
And Ulysses surely couldn't resist.

This meal was fire, and they ate with glee,
Their hearts so full, they couldn't disagree.
This feast was like the top TikTok trend,
It had everyone talking, until the very end.

Yo, let me tell you 'bout Ctesippus, oh what a clown,
He's makin' his way to Minerva with riches that astound.
Thinking he's the coolest in this hall,
He's makin' moves on Ulysses' wife, without any call. 

He's sayin' "Yo, check out this guest,
He's had his share, he's already blessed.
But, for the sake of hospitality,
I'm giving him a gift, for my nobility." 

Ctesippus thinks he can flirt and play,
As if it's all fair game and okay.
But Minerva's not fooled by his façade,
She wants Ulysses' wrath to be his squad. 

So Ctesippus, with his arrogance and pride,
Will soon regret the decisions he tried.
To court the queen and mock their guest,
He's messed with the wrong man, he'll soon be distressed.

This scene's got drama, it's straight out of a soap,
Telemachus is grown now, no longer a little dope.
Ctesippus, you better watch where you throw,
Or else he'll run you through with his spear, don't you know?

Ulysses dodges the heifer's foot with ease,
These guys need to learn some proper hospitality, please.
Telemachus is sick of the violence and shame,
One man against many, it's not much of a game.

Killing sheep and stealing wine is not cool,
Treating guests and women bad, that's just being a fool.
Telemachus has spoken, it's time to be kind,
And leave that uncivilized behavior behind.

Yo, what's good my homies? Let's chat,
Agelaus has the right idea, no need to get all that 
drama on the servant or the stranger,
peeps need to be kind and not put them in danger.

Telemachus and his mom, listen up, hear me out,
I get it, you've been waiting for him, no need to pout,
but let's be real, Ulysses ain't comin' back,
so it's time to move on, no need to keep track.

Talk to your mama, make a plan,
find a man who can be your number one fan,
let her marry the one with the sweetest deal,
so you can chill and eat a meal.

Get your inheritance in order, 
don't be a hoarder,
living your best life is what you need to do,
while your mama tends to another man's crew. 

Trust me guys, it'll all work out fine,
just stay grounded and always be kind,
let's end all this mess and strife,
and live a happy, drama-free life!

Oh dang, Agelaus, why you gotta be so mad,  
Telemachus ain't about to make his mama sad.  
While gifts are up for grabs and wedding bells can chime,  
it's up to Penelope to choose, it's her time to shine.  

Forced love, that's not the way to go,  
Telemachus knows and wants mama to know  
that he won't make her leave the grounds,  
no way would he lay those kinds of bounds.  

Whether Dad's gone or just all alone,  
Telemachus will do his part from home.  
So let's not fight and start a war,  
let's settle down and say no more.

Yo, the suitors were chatting through their feast,
But Minerva pulled up and disturbed their seat,
Made 'em laugh like hyenas, but it wasn't a treat,
Their meat got messed up and their tears dropped with defeat.

Theoclymenus took one look and exclaimed,
"What's got y'all down? This energy's deranged,
You're covered in darkness, cheeks stained,
With tears, walls drippin' blood, ghosts unrestrained.

The gloom's covering the sun, this scene's insane,
But don't worry, I got some insight to explain,
It's just Athena wreckin' y'all's brain,
Suitors put some respect on the queen of the game."

Oh snap, did Eurymachus just diss
Our dear stranger with his massive diss?
He called him crazy, said he's lost his mind
But we know that our stranger is one of a kind

Hey Eurymachus, do you even know
That you're about to face a major blow?
Our stranger is no ordinary guy,
He's got skills that'll make your heart fly high

Servants, don't listen to this hater
Let's show him just how our stranger is greater
He's been through it all, he's braved the night
And now you throw him out of sight?

Eurymachus, you should watch your back
Our stranger's no joke, no small hack
He may seem a little out of place
But he's got a heart with a steady pace

So don't mess with him, don't give him a diss
Or you'll find yourself in Major L's abyss
Now let's show our stranger some major love
'Cause he's a gift from the heavens above.

Hold up, did you hear what Theoclymenus said?
He don't need no one to escort him to bed.
He's got his own eyeballs, ears, and feet
He'll figure out what's going on, don't you retreat.

He can see the mischief in the air
The plotting and scheming, it's a dare.
These men are insulting and causing strife
But Theoclymenus will figure it out with his own life.

No need for a sidekick, he's got it handled
His understanding mind won't be dismantled.
So let's sit back and watch the show
Theoclymenus is about to steal the flow. 

PS: is it just me or does Theoclymenus sound like a troll face meme?

Listen, suitors, don't be so shady
Your ridicule is hella outdated and wavy
Telemachus is kind to offer hospitality
You can't handle his show of generosity, so hilarity
Insulting his guests, really? That's just low 
Especially when you got no game, like a zero 
Piraeus welcomes him with open arms 
While you guys continue your silly charms
Just because they don't fit your standard mold 
Doesn't mean they deserve to be sold 
Quit your clowning, stop pretending to be real 
Or you'll get roasted, like a cowardly heel.

Oh my gosh, Telemachus just sat there,
Watching his dad without a single care,
He knew his dad was about to attack,
And the suitors were in for a big smack.

But seriously, it's like he didn't even listen,
To the plan that his dad had been dishin',
He just sat there, expectant and still,
While Odysseus prepared for the kill.

Like, I get it, Odysseus is a warrior,
And he's about to make things a bit gorier,
But Telemachus should at least show support,
And maybe even offer up his own retort.

Either way, this drama is off the chain,
It's like a Greek tragedy without any strain,
And the suitors better watch out, they better be quick,
Or else they'll end up like that vine, "they did surgery on a grape" - just a statistic.

Goddamn, Penelope was chilling, listening to every word,
Sitting in her lavish seat, looking like a cultured bird.
The dinner was lit, sacrifices were made to the gods,
But the real feast was yet to come, and it was like nothing you've seen odds.

The goddess and the brave man were about to serve their fate,
And no one would be left unaffected, no one could debate.
It's like they brought this doom upon themselves, what were they thinking?
Now it was time for the consequences, the universe was unblinking.

Get ready for a wild ride, it's about to go down,
In ways that will leave you rattled, nothing to cover the frown.
Penelope was cool, calm, collected, and ready to see,
What fate had in store, it was bound to be one for history.

I'm hype as hell, can't wait to see what happens next,
Hold tight, baby, we're about to get wrecked.
No use fighting it, just let it happen, it's okay,
We're all doomed, but we can only hope we'll live on someday.

Hey hey, gather 'round and don't be shy
I've got a story that'll open your third eye
It's got the drama, the spice, and the tea
All the gossip you could ever dream to see

It starts with a girl, she's got it all
The Instagram likes and the perfect fall
But don't be fooled by her shining facade
Because underneath, she's feeling flawed

She meets a guy and thinks he's the one
Their romance is lit, like a midsummer sun
But then she finds out, he's got a secret
And it's something she never could expect it

He's a meme lord, with a talent so rare
His internet fame, she just can't compare
But the attention and the likes, they're just a facade
And deep down, he's feeling flawed

Together they learned, that life's not perfect
And sometimes it's not worth it
To hide behind screens and pretend to be
Someone we're not, in order to be seen

So let this be a lesson, for all you and me
We don't have to put on a show, just to be free
Embrace the real, embrace the you
Because being unique, is the coolest thing to do!

BOOK XXI

Listen up, y'all, to a tale so bold
Of a queen named Penelope, so smart and so cold
She be thinking 'bout ways to get rid of the crowd
Of suitors who, all day, shouting aloud

Minerva came through and whispered, you see,
"Make 'em compete with bow and axe, oh-so-freely"
She went upstairs to get the key so right
Bronze with ivory handle, shiny and bright

To the store room they went, right at the end of the house
Where treasures and weapons, no need to espouse
Including a bow and quiver, truly grand
Gifted by Iphitus, a legendary man

Ulysses and Iphitus, they be like peas in a pod
Met as dudes, tried to reclaim horses, a trip kinda odd
But Hercules, his power like a bomb
Killed Iphitus, didn't care about the bond

From Iphitus, Ulysses got a bow, so rare
A friendship so true, beyond compare
Used it at home, never took it to Troy
Left it as a keepsake, all sentimental and coy

As Penelope approached the suitors' site,
Her tears were falling, there was no light.
But with her, she carried a strong bow,
And a quiver of arrows, deadly like wow.

Her maidens trailed behind her with grace,
Holding a chest filled with iron and bronze to embrace.
As she stood before the suitors, filled with dread,
She held a veil before her face as she said:

"Which one of you brave men will string this bow?
And shoot an arrow, straight and slow?
My husband did it with ease in the past,
But alas, he's gone and this chance won't last."

The suitors scoffed, thinking they were tough,
They tried to string it, but it was far too rough.
Then out of nowhere, a stranger appeared,
And with one swift movement, the bow was reared.

'Cause our mystery guest was none other than Odysseus,
Who showed the suitors who the real boss is.
With his bow and arrow, he tore them apart,
And reclaimed his throne with a warrior's heart. 

In the end, Penelope was joyous and relieved,
That her true love had finally achieved,
Peace in his castle, and love in his heart,
Forever and ever, and that's a true art.

Yo, suitors, you won't believe it's true
Just trying to marry me for a few
You're all abusing the hospitality of this place
But I got news for you, you should save face

To win my heart, a challenge you'll face
The mighty bow of Ulysses is the case
String it easily, send the arrow through each axe
And I'll marry whoever's skill makes the best tracks

I'll ditch this house from my lawful spouse
And follow the one who owns the house
But in my dreams, I'll remember and gleam
About the one who wins with the best dream

Oh snap, Antinous thinks he's so slick,
But he and his suitors are in for a trick.
The queen has spoken, her orders were clear,
Eumaeus wept, he wasn't able to cheer.

The stockman cried too, when he saw the bow,
Antinous scolded them, acting like a big wow.
He called them "silly simpletons", acting like a tool,
But we know who the real fool is, that's the rule.

He ain't no match for Ulysses, that's for sure,
The suitors will see when they try to endure.
Stringing that bow is no easy feat,
They'll be sweating and grunting to complete.

So come on Antinous, bring your A-game,
But we all know that you're not the same.
Ulysses was the king of this land,
And no one can step up to his command.

Oh my gosh, can you even believe
What this guy is trying to achieve?
He's dissing Ulysses in his own crib,
Encouraging others to be so glib.

But little did he know or expect,
That out of his house he'd be so quickly checked.
Ulysses is a true king with a bow so strong,
His shots will leave you singing a woeful song.

This dude thought he had it all figured out,
But Ulysses proved him wrong, no doubt.
He was the first to get an arrow in the face,
A lesson learned, don't mess with Ulysses' grace.

Now, let's take a moment to recognize,
That Ulysses is the real prize.
He'll always defend his honor and name,
And defeat his enemies in the ultimate game. 

#OopsIDidUseAHashtag #MyBad #MyRhymesAreSoSick #LitFam #Slay #YasQueen #HipHopHooray #NewMemeWhoDis #UlyssesIsKing #BowDown #Respect

Telemachus spoke, his words were loud and clear,
Jove must have robbed him of his senses, oh dear!
His mother, she wants to remarry,
But Telemachus is here, all merry.

The suitors, they've agreed upon a test,
To see who can shoot the arrow best,
For a woman fair and true,
Whose equal cannot be found, it's true.

Telemachus, he'll show them all,
He won't let his mother fall,
He'll try to shoot the arrow too,
And win the prizes his father knew.

Let's get this show on the road,
No need for delays, let's unload,
The bow and arrow, and let's see,
Who's the best archer, it's time to claim victory.

Yo, he rose from his seat with a mighty spring,
Threw off his cloak, took his sword and everything.
He set the axes straight, made a groove in the ground,
Tamped it tight and everyone was like "wow" out loud.

Then he went to the pavement to try the bow,
Pulled as hard as he could, but it wouldn't go.
He tried it thrice, with all his might and main,
But had to stop, though he hoped for a different gain.

On the fourth try, he almost did succeed,
But Ulysses stopped him with great lead.
He made a sign to halt all the action,
Saying "We have a test of another fashion."

Yo, listen up, this dude is feeling quite unsure,
Either he's weak or just too young to endure.
He throws the bow, feeling quite incomplete,
But he's right, his strength hasn't reached its peak.

To all the others, this is your chance,
Show off your strength, show off your dance.
Make trial of the bow, let's settle this score,
Whoever wins, we'll cheer for evermore.

So come on, flex those muscles and show us your might,
Give us something to tweet about all night.
Let's see who's got the skills, who's got the game,
And let's hope this contest ends in sweet sweet fame.

Yo yo yo, hold up a sec,
Let me tell you 'bout this neck wreck.
Odysseus with the moves so sly,
Antinous ready to ask him why.

Odysseus puts his bow down,
Antinous gives him a frown.
But our boy just chills on his throne
Ready to call this world his own.

"Who gave you permission to touch the bow?"
Antinous tries to flex, but we all know
Odysseus can best him in a fight
Just like when Drake killed Meek Mill's career that night.

Okay okay okay, let's get lit
Everybody take a sip, don't quit
Pass it to the right, gotta keep it tight
Like a game of hot potato, don't fight

The cupbearer leads the way, like a boss
We gotta follow, no matter the cost
Take a deep breath, take a step
Pass that cup, but don't spill and let it drip

It's like a ritual, a tradition so old
Just like that viral meme that never gets old
But instead of likes, we pass the wine
And keep the party going until we feel fine

Leiodes tried to string the bow,
But his weak hands just couldn't go.
He sat in the corner, filled with hate,
For the suitors' evil deeds, he couldn't relate.

He went up to make the trial,
But his strength couldn't go the mile.
He said, "My friends, I cannot swing,
Let another give this bow a fling.

This bow shall take the life and soul,
Out of many a chief who once were whole.
For it's better to die than to miss,
The prize that's brought us here, I insist.

Some of us hope and pray,
To marry Penelope in every way.
But if you want her hand in matrimony,
This bow is your one and only.

So woo another woman with your charm,
And let Penelope fall into another's arms.
But whoever wins her must make the best offer,
For this bow's power is the perfect coffer."

"Oh no he didn't just leave his bow leaning, like he's got no feelings! Hating on my man like he's some kind of villain, you best step back and sit stillin'."

Telemachus replied with a smirk and a grin, "Sorry man, I didn't mean to cause such a spin. But this bow is more than just a simple toy, it's a symbol of power, it brings me joy."

Antinous rolled his eyes, looking quite annoyed, "You're just a little boy, you're not a royal decoy. You'll never be king, don't even try to sing. Give us the bow now, or we'll make you feel the pow."

But Telemachus stood tall, not afraid to brawl, "I'm done with your lies, your tricks and your gall. I'll show you all that I can be, just wait and see." 

And with a confident nod, he picked up the bow with pride. Ready to show everyone, that he won't just hide.

Yo, Odysseus, hear me out
Your words, they just bring me doubt
"Monstrous and intolerable"?
That just ain't relatable

You're mad 'cause I can't bend this bow
But, bro, you should know by now
I wasn't born to be an archer
But there are others who are a lot sharper

This bow ain't worthy of claim
It's just fanning your ego flame
Why risk many a chief's life
When there's more to gain with less strife?

Let's put down this ancient weapon
And opt for a more modern selection
Like a team, we can conquer all
And make sure every boss takes the fall

Ayo, listen up, Melanthius my dude,  
You gotta light a fire, don't be rude  
Get a sheep skin seat for us to chill  
And bring some lard, yeah that's the drill  

We'll warm up and grease the bow with care  
Then we'll test it out, let's see what's fair  
The contest will end, all eyes on us  
So let's get lit, and make no fuss  

As the cool kids say, YOLO, right?  
We gotta do this, with all our might  
So let's get started, don't be slow  
We'll finish strong, and steal the show  

And speaking of stealing, mind the flocks  
Or you'll be catching hands, that's the rocks  
But I trust you, don't make me wrong  
Now let's get back to this bow song.  

Yeet!

Oh dang, the suitors be trying,
But their strength ain't satisfying,
Melanthius had them warm the bow,
Yet still their efforts fell very low.

Antinous and Eurymachus remain,
They won't give up and call it a game,
The ringleaders of this whole pursuit,
They won't stop until they get the loot.

But let's be real, they won't succeed,
Their attempts are sad, they don't proceed,
They need some muscles, some real might,
Maybe then they can win the fight.

Until then, they just can't cope,
Not even with the power of the dope,
It's time for a new plan of action,
The suitors need to find some traction.

But until then, they sit and wait,
Trying to string the bow, their ultimate fate,
In the end, it's clear to see,
Only Odysseus is the one who's key.

Hold up, hold up, let me intervene,
I've been lost on this island, you know what I mean?
I'm tryna get back home, to the place where I rule,
And I could use some help, if that's cool with you, fool.

The swineherd and stockman were taken aback,
"This dude talks so strange," they silently quacked,
But despite their apprehension, they decided to aid,
And lead him away from the cloisters' shade.

Ulysses was grateful, he nodded and smiled,
And they walked for a while, every step versatile,
Until Ulysses whispered, with a sense of elation,
"Thank you, my dudes, for the sweet navigation."

Yo, yo, yo, what's good, Stockman and Swineherd too?
Your girl, Athena, has got some real talk for you.
I'm debating whether or not to spill the tea,
So just sit tight and listen up to me. 

If Ulysses came back, would you be on his side,
Or would you stay with the suitors and their lies?
It's time to choose, are you real or fake?
'Cause Athena doesn't have time for those who can't keep it straight. 

Would you be like, "Bye Felicia" to the suitors for sure,
Stand with Odysseus and make his welcome pure,
'Cause if you're not, I guess you're just a basic troll,
And it'll be time for you to go back to your hole. 

So what's it gonna be, the suitors or the man,
'Cause Athena's tired of this endless stand?
Make the right choice and you might get a high five,
Make the wrong one and you'll be left with only bye-bye. 

#sorrynotsorry #choosewisely #AthenaOut.

Yo, Father Jove, mighty and high
Please hear the stockman's battle cry
If only some god could bring back Ulysses
We'd fight for him with all our stresses

With might and main, we'd go all out
And show those foes what we're about
Bring back our hero, make it quick
We'll use our skills to do the trick 

Like gods on earth, we'll stand up tall
And make our enemies take a hard fall
So please, oh please, won't you hear our plea?
Bring back Ulysses, so we can be free. 

#BringBackUlysses #StockmanSquad #FatherJoveBlessedUs

Yo, Eumaeus was praying mad hard,
Hoping and wishing that Ulysses would come back unscarred.
Then Ulysses himself stepped up to the plate,
Saying, "It's me, guys, I'm finally returning, no need to debate."

Only two of his servants were hyped to see him back,
The other ones must've had some serious swack.
So Ulysses promised a bright future ahead,
Wives, homes, and siblings, all in good stead.

To prove his identity, he showed them his boar scar,
The one he got hunting, man that was bizarre.

Hold up, fam, let's not be sad,
This ain't a funeral, it ain't so bad.
I know you miss Ulysses and all he brought,
But I'm right here, and I ain't forgot.

Look at this scar, it tells a tale,
Of my long journey, I did prevail.
And now I'm back, standing strong,
Ready to right every wrong.

So let's wipe away those tears,
And overcome all of our fears.
With Ulysses' memory in our heart,
We'll make a brand new start.

Just like that meme, "Keep calm and carry on",
We'll keep moving forward from dusk 'til dawn.
So let's embrace like true homies do,
And make sure that Ulysses is proud of me and you.

Chill out and stop the tear droppin',
Lest someone catches us moppin'.
When we go up, no need to be clingin',
We gotta play it cool and not be singin'.

I'll go in first and act like a boss,
You'll follow me, and avoid any loss.
Here's the secret sign, listen clear,
If my plan fails, we'll be in fear.

The suitors will try to stop my goal,
Of grabbing the bow, and taking control.
So Eumaeus, my boy, place it in my hand,
And tell those ladies to take their stand.

If there's a ruckus, don't come out,
Stay in your place, don't scream or shout.
Philoetius, my man, lock the doors,
Protect our crew, and secure all floors.

Yo, yo, yo, listen up, this is a story that's gonna be lit,
Our main character has just made a quick split,
He bounced back to his house without a single sound,
And his servants trailed along, looking pretty astound.

The way he rolled in, he took that seat like a boss,
Making his presence known, without any loss.
Then came his servants, following his lead,
Wondering what kind of plan this boss had up his sleeve.

This story's got potential, it's gonna be rad,
Like the memes we share that make us all so glad,
So sit tight, get ready, coz' there's more to come,
This boss is just getting started, and we'll spill the outcome.

Yo, peeps listen up, it's crazy to think
Eurymachus tried, but his bow wouldn't link
He was heated, stressed, and full of grief,
For he couldn't string it, no matter the belief

He sighed real deep, and spoke from his heart,
"I'm not sad 'bout the wedding, cuz that's just a part
Of life that I'll forget in a day or two,
What really hits me is that we're so weak and untrue

Compared to Ulysses, we're just small fry,
Can't even string his bow, which makes us wanna cry
It's shameful, embarrassing, a stain on our name,
This will haunt our descendants and bring them great shame." 

But don't worry, peeps, we've got time to train,
We'll get stronger and better, and won't feel the pain
So let's pick up the pieces, and start from scratch,
And give Ulysses' bow another go without any hatch. 

Like that time when Spongebob taught us to fail,
We'll rise up stronger, and our skills will assail
And who knows, maybe we'll exceed his might,
And Eurymachus will get hitched, it'll all be alright.

"Yo Eurymachus, hold up a sec,"
Antinous proclaimed with much respect,
"Apollo's feast is today, my man,
Who'd want to string a bow when they can
Be sippin' on drinks while chillin' here?
We don't need to worry, have no fear,
Let's just drop this bow contest for now,
And bring in some goats tomorrow, thou
Melanthius can provide the best,
And we'll put our archery skills to the test.
Thigh bones offered to Apollo above,
Our feast will be lit, my dudes - so much love."

Hey, listen up, I've got a tale to spin,
A wild story that'll make your head spin, 
It's about me, your boy, Ulysses, 
And my journey full of twists and sneaky processes. 

I've seen Cyclops and sirens, oh gosh,
I tell ya, it's a trip, quite the rush,
But I've made it through, all tough and brash, 
Surviving every danger with a little bit of panache. 

Now I'm back on Ithaca, my home turf, 
With all my loyal peeps, my ride or die serfs,
But something's fishy, something just ain't right, 
I gotta figure this out before we say goodnight. 

So if you're ready to hear this epic saga, 
Sit back, drink your drink, and enjoy the drama,
'Cause Ulysses has returned, and he's here to stay,
With more stories to share, and plenty to convey.

Hey yo, all you potential mates,
Hear me out before it's too late.
Eurymachus, Antinous, lend me your ear,
Let's put down the arrows and have no fear.

Let fate decide who's worthy and who's not,
We'll leave it up to the gods, give it a thought.
But for now, hand me the bow,
I'll show you what I can bestow.

I've been on the road, traveled far and wide,
But let me prove that my strength hasn't died.
I may be older, but don't you know,
Wisdom comes with age, just like a meme flow.

Yo, this guy Antinous is straight-up ruthless,
Making fun of this man and his lack of horse-tooth;
He's calling him a wretched creature with no sense,
Dissing him in front of his betters with no pretense.

He's saying that this guy's drunk on wine,
And that he's not fit to hear their divine,
Conversation; that he's lucky to be here,
And he shouldn't even try to come near.

Antinous is dropping mad history,
About a Centaur who got drunk on wine, you see,
And did crazy stuff that caused a war,
Between mankind and Centaurs that we're still sure.

He's telling this man, it'll go bad if he strings,
The bow, and that he'll have no mercy if it stings,
Any of these men, then he'll be out for good,
Going straight to a king who's known to be rude.

So this man just needs to chill and drink,
Keep his head down and not cause a stink,
Or else he'll be sent away to die,
And from their table, they'll say goodbye.

Yo, Antinous, Penelope just spoke
And her opinion is no joke
It ain't right to mistreat a guest
Telemachus would be quite distressed

If the stranger can string the bow
Can you imagine the love he'll sow?
Do you really think he'll take her away?
Don't ruin the feast with your crazy sway

Even the man himself knows it's not right
So don't let that mess up the night
It's out of all reason, can't you see?
Just let the guest be, let him be free.

Oh snap, hear what Eurymachus has to say,
About our boy Odysseus and his famous display,
The suitors fear that the people will talk,
Saying their strength was nothing, just weak like a TikTok.

They paid court to Penelope but couldn't string the bow,
But then came our hero who put on a show,
They don't want a tramp to steal their fame,
And diminish their status and name.

But let's be real, this story is old news,
Odysseus proved himself, he's got nothing to prove,
No one can deny his mad archery skills,
He's got the talent that gives us all the chills.

So let the people gossip and chat,
We know the truth, and that's where it's at,
Odysseus is the man, that's plain to see,
And we'll rock on his side, like the memelords we be.

Penelope, oh Penelope, a queen with dope style,
Calls out Eurymachus, who dares to eat and defile,
The estate of her hubby, the one and only great chieftain,
And who expects others to think well of his poor action.
"Why should you care if men talk as you wackly think they will?"
Says the queen who shows her words have a lethal skill.
This stranger ain't no joke, he's strong, well-built and bold,
Plus he claims to be of noble birth, worth more than gold.
Give him the bow, and let's see if he can string it tight,
And if he does, I'll reward him with clothes, shoes, and might,
A javelin to fend off dogs and robbers without a fuss,
And a sharp sword shining bright, which he can use to crush.
I'll make sure he is safe wherever his travels may take him,
With shoes on his feet, and a heart of gold not fading.

Oh dang, Telemachus spittin' bars
Talkin' 'bout a bow that's his by far
No one can force him to give it away
Not even if they come to play

He's the king of Ithaca, the man in charge
No one can take that from him or enlarge
This bow is his, no question asked
He's a boss, never flustered or masked

So, Mama, go do your thing
Looming and distaffing, whatta zing
This bow is a man's world, a man's domain
Telemachus runs this, no need to explain.

Yas queen went back inside, head heavy as a boulder,
Her son's words ringing in her heart, making it colder.
She went upstairs with her squad, feeling so bleak,
Mourning her hubby, it was so peak.

But then, like a gift from the meme-gods above,
Minerva blessed her with sleep, like a love-
ly blanket so warm and cozy, she slept like a boss,
Dreaming of avocado toast and Ryan Gosling's abs.

Oh snap, the swineherd got the bow, 
But the suitors were like "no, no, no!" 
They shouted and hollered, "You're going insane!" 
"If we get our wish, you'll feel some serious pain!" 

Those suitors acted like such clowns, 
Thinking themselves as kings with crowns, 
But Ulysses was the one who would reign, 
And with the bow, he'd bring them lots of pain. 

The swineherd didn't let them get him down, 
Through the throng, he made his way around, 
Delivered the bow to his lord and kin, 
And soon the suitors' fate would be really dim. 

But for now, the drama did not cease, 
The tension started to increase, 
For Ulysses was about to show, 
Just how well he could use his bow. 

#SorryNotSorry #SwineherdMoves #UlyssesOnTop #BowWow #BoarHoundsBeCrazy

Oh snap, Telemachus is not playing around
He's got Eumaeus in his sights, ready to pound
Throwing stones like it's nobody's business
To him, being the better man is the only fitness

The suitors in the house better watch their backs
Telemachus is not afraid to attack
He's got some serious anger brewing
And he's not about to let anyone ruin

His father's home, oh no, no way
Telemachus is ready to slay
With his strong arms and quick wit
He'll make sure those suitors quit

So bring on that bow, Eumaeus, don't be scared
Telemachus is here to show he's prepared
To defend his home and family name
And put the suitors to shame. 

#NoHashtags #NoYo #LitAF

Ulysses was ready to go,
With the bow in his hand, not too slow.
Telemachus' men laughed along,
Heartily, to keep spirits strong.
Eumaeus brought the weapon to him,
With caution and care, mighty and grim.

He then told Euryclea with ease,
"Just close the doors, if you please.
If there's any trouble or noise,
Don't step out, don't make a choice.
Stay put and keep on plotting,
Let the men do the fighting."

So the women obeyed, and they hushed,
No sound, no movement, no rush.
Just the bowstring drawing tight,
A surprising and satisfying sight.

Oh snap, watch out for Euryclea, she's closing up shop like a boss,
Making sure the ladies have their privacy, no need for any loss.
She's following orders like a true queen bee,
Gotta respect her hustle, she's the MVP. 

Like seriously, she's straight up legit,
Keeping things on point, never gonna quit.
Closing those doors like it's no big deal,
Making sure everything's secure, that's the real deal.

And with that, the ladies have their space,
No need for any commotion, they've found their place.
Euryclea's doing her thing, making sure everything's set,
Can't stop her shine, she's a true internet.

So let's give it up for Euryclea, doing what she's told,
Keeping everything on point and never getting old.
She's an OG in her own right, always on fleek,
Keeping things locked down, never missing a beat.

As Philoetius dipped, he made the gates secure,
While Ulysses fiddled, the master of allure,
The byblus fiber was the anchor in store,
Used to keep invaders, the gates just ain't a bore.

The bow in his hand, he inspected it well,
Like some kind of wizard, in some kind of spell,
Neighbours, distraught, shout, "Hey, what's up with old chap?",
"Looks like some skilled trickster, who's making a trap."

Perhaps he's got one, a bow of his own,
Or maybe he's here, to craft and to hone,
His skills in the talents, of arrow and string,
Using his mastery, of each little thing.

"Ha! You think he's a loser just like Jake Paul's boxing skills, 
But our boy will show you how to create some major thrills. 
He'll string that bow like it's no one's business, 
Just like that viral TikTok dance, done with perfect fitness. 
Don't underestimate him, he's got the power of Gen Z, 
He'll prove you wrong and make you see!"

Oh dang, what a story here,
About Ulysses, yeah he's quite the peer.
He picked up a bow, with skill and ease,
Like a skilled bard strumming their keys.

The string sang sweetly like a swallow,
And the suitors knew they were in for a hard swallow.
Their faces turned pale as they heard the sound,
And even Jove thundered above, impact profound.

Ulysses felt joy in his heart,
For he knew it was a sign from above, a great start.
The son of scheming Saturn had his back,
And now he knew the suitors' courage would lack.

"Damn son, did you see that shot?
All those axes, not a miss, they got caught!
Now listen up, Telemachus my dude,
We got no time for slacking, gotta include
The suitors, they need to be put in their place,
With their bad attitudes and their messy space.
We'll make them pay, make them regret
Ever stepping foot in this house, you bet.
So let's get to work, don't wait or stall,
It's time for us to show them all who's ballin'."

Yooo Telemachus, your guest is slick,
He hit his target, he’s no weak prick.
His strength is real, ain't no façade,
No need to listen to the suitors and their squad.

Now is the time to dine and feast,
And party down like the ancient Greeks,
Sing and dance till the night is through,
That's how they do it, it's nothing new.

So let's get lit with the food and drink,
And let the music flow, let’s not think,
It’s time to celebrate this victory,
And enjoy this moment wild and free.

As pops spoke, brows high like a wave,  
Telemachus got ready to be brave.  
He grabbed a sword, spear in hand too,  
Ready to fight, like a boss through and through.  

He stood beside his father so strong,  
Protected by armor both thick and long.  
No one could defeat this dynamic duo,  
They were ready to slay, like a Fortnite pro.  

With a nod and a gleam in his eye,  
Odysseus fired up and let out a battle cry.  
His son, by his side, stood firm and true,  
Their foes to conquer, like a boss crew.  

So they charged forward, without any fear,  
Ready to fight and make their foes disappear.

BOOK XXII

Ulysses is on the scene, 
In rags, he looked so lean. 
But now, he's got his bow and arrows, 
He's ready to hit all heroic zeros. 

He drops his arrows on the ground,
His feet to the pavement, so profound.
He wants a new target to hit,
It's time to show off his shooting wit.

Will Apollo make the target glow,
So Ulysses can let his talent show?
Let's hope he hits it like a boss, 
Like Kim K's cry face when she is at a loss.

Yo, Ulysses was a master of his craft,
Deftly shooting arrows from his arm so daft.
With Antinous holding his goblet of gold,
The warrior's arrow hit him hard and bold.

He didn't think death was near,
With so many revelers, he had no fear.
But the arrow in his throat was true,
And Antinous fell, his life now through.

Blood spurted from his nose,
As he kicked the table in his throes.
The bread and meat fell to the ground,
A chaotic scene, not very sound.

The suitors were angry, they raised their voice,
No weaponry in sight, they had no choice.
They blamed Ulysses for the deadly shot,
Their anger evident, their rage so hot.

"You'll pay for this, you stranger man,
For killing this Ithacan with your own hand.
Antinous was the best of youth,
And now he's gone, because of you, uncouth!"

But Ulysses wasn't scared one bit,
He knew his actions couldn't be unfit.
He's a hero in his own right,
And would fight with all his might.

So if they want to come for him,
They best have their wits about them.
Ulysses is a man not to mess,
So let the games begin, no stress!

Yo, hold up, let me get this straight
Y'all think I murdered Antinous by mistake?
Nah fam, that's not the case
Death's hangin' over all y'all's face

You better watch out, have some fear
'Cause when it comes, it won't be clear
Like when you see a ghost, sayin' "oof"
Or when your ex texts you with "boop"

I'm not here to kill, I'm here to rule
And when it comes to that, I'm no fool
I'm the king of this palace, don't you forget
Like when you flex on the Gram with a fresh outfit

So don't you dare try to cross me
I'll make you regret it, you'll see
Like when you try to jinx your friend
And they come back with a "no u" trend.

Hold up, wait a minute, let's rewind 
Odysseus is back and he's taking what's mine 
Dogs, y'all can't front like you didn't know 
He's poppin' off on you for stealing his dough 

You've been living large, spending all his cash 
And his lady's been lowkey making a pass 
But he ain't messing around, he's filled with rage 
You messed with the wrong dude, you're all about to get caged 

You thought you could mess with him and get away 
But now you're in trouble, you've got a price to pay 
The gods won't protect you, you're on your own 
Odysseus has returned and he's taking back his throne 

So let this be a lesson, listen up y'all 
Don't try to mess with someone who's standing tall 
Odysseus is a boss, he won't be ignored 
And if you cross him, you'll be sorry when you're floored 

#HomerGotBars #OdysseusIsBack #TryingToMessWithHimIsWhack

Oh snap, things got real abrupt,
Eurymachus the only one who didn't interrupt,
All these dudes looking for a place to hide,
Scaredy-cats, can't handle the vibes.

But Eurymachus, he had the nerve,
He wasn't gonna go and swerve,
Like a boss, he spoke up clear,
No hesitations, he had no fear.

These guys need to take a chill pill,
Eurymachus is showing some real skill,
He's not afraid to step up and be seen,
He's the real MVP, know what I mean?

Yo, Ulysses, you speak the truth
Your lands were wronged, that's uncouth
Antinous, who caused the strife
Is now nowhere to be seen in life

It wasn't just about marrying Penelope
He wanted to be top dog, that's plenty dope
But Jove had other plans for him
He met his demise in a situation grim

Now that he's paid the price for what he did
Spare the rest of us, show some skid
We'll make it up to you, that's no lie
With fines worth twenty oxen, we'll comply

We'll keep paying you in gold and bronze
Till your heart softens, and you say "yawns"
Until then, no one can fuss
We'll make things right, that's a must.

Ulysses is not playing, he's serious biz
His enemies better run or face the quiz
He's not asking for money or a little fix
He just wants payback, no playing tricks

You better watch out, you better take heed
Ulysses is here for revenge, no time to plead
He won't stop until he gets what he needs
His enemies better run, they better leave 

Ulysses wants to teach them a lesson
His enemies better pray and start confessin'
There's no point in trying to make a suggestion
Ulysses will win, this is no profession

So listen up, listen up one and all
Ulysses is ready for the brawl
There's no point in trying to fall
Or he'll hit you harder than a wrecking ball 

His enemies don't stand a chance 
They're like a tweet with no glance
Ulysses is like a viral dance
His enemies better run, no second chance.

"Dude, why you gotta be so intense?
Can't we all just make amends?
You're acting like a real hater,
Let's just chill, be cool, no need to be an instigator."

But Odysseus wasn't having it,
He stood tall, wasn't gonna quit.
"You guys are acting like a bunch of clowns,
Trying to steal my home, my crown."

The suitors tried to play it off,
But they were about to face a loss.
Odysseus had a plan up his sleeve,
And it was gonna make them all leave.

The tension in the room was thick,
But Odysseus stood strong and slick.
The suitors may have thought they were slick,
But Odysseus was ready to kick.

So buckle up, it's about to go down,
Odysseus is about to take the crown.
No more games, no more clownin',
He's taking back what's rightfully his, no more frownin'.

Hold up, hold up, let me tell ya'll a tale  
'Bout a shooter standing strong and wielding his hail  
He won't show no mercy, won't even give us a chance  
Till every man among us falls, and we end up in a trance  

So let's show some grit, let's not back down  
Pull out your swords, and hold up the tables to surround  
And rush at him with all our might, to push him back  
And get through to the town, where we won't be whacked  

We'll sound the alarm, make it go viral on the net  
With tweets and posts that'll make him regret  
And let the world know, we ain't backing down  
We're gonna fight till the end, with no frown  

So let's band together, and show that we're strong  
Even when things go wrong  
We'll never back down, and always stand our ground  
We'll be a force to be reckoned with, and be forever renowned.

Yo, Ulysses was chillin', just tryna eat a meal,
Then Antinous stepped up with his sword of steel,
But Ulysses was quick and with a swiftness,
Shot an arrow through his nipple with amazing fitness.

Antinous dropped his sword and the food hit the ground,
He collapsed on the table, lost and never to be found,
As he writhed in pain, Ulysses looked on with a smirk,
And Antinous kicked the stool, his movements hard and berserk.

He hit the ground, all the meats scattered like debris,
And as he breathed his last, Ulysses had a moment free,
The arrow pierced his liver, his cries died in his chest,
And thus ended Antinous, slain by Ulysses, the very best. 

#NoCap #UlyssesIsTheMan #ArrowToTheNipple #RIPAntinous

"Dad, you're a G, there's no debate,
But this guy Amphinomus was ready to hate.
He drew his sword and came at you fierce,
But I was like nah, that energy we don't need to pierce.

I snuck up behind him, with speed and with grace,
My spear went through his chest, and soon was in place.
I didn't stick around to remove the blade,
I'd rather not be surrounded and get flayed.

Now here I am, your trusty heir,
Just like we planned, we make a great pair.
But Dad, we've still got work to do,
The suitors are many, and their betrayal is true."

Ulysses looked at his son with pride in his heart,
"You're right, my boy, we can't be torn apart.
We'll take on these suitors, and show them our might,
And with Athena's help, we'll keep fighting the fight."

Hold up, pops, lemme get this straight
You need some gear before it's too late 
I got you covered, don't you fret 
Shields, spears and helmets are what you'll get 

I'll get prepared with swords and plates 
And hook up the swineherd with some weight 
Stockman, you're included too 
We gotta be ready, it's what we gotta do 

It's time to act, no time to chill 
War is upon us, it's time to thrill 
So let's roll out, get ready to fight 
With our weapons shining, we'll take flight 

I'm on a mission, won't let you down 
We'll show these haters who wears the crown 
So let's get this armour, let's get it fresh 
We'll be ready for war, we'll be the best.

Yo, Ulysses is in danger, let's get lit and rearrange 'er,
He's gotta fetch some arrows, before they start to harrow,
They're comin' for his life, gonna cut through like a knife,
But with his arrows in tow, he'll take 'em down like a pro.

Run and fetch 'em, he said, or I'll be filled with dread,
If I'm left all on my own, it'll be a danger zone,
I gotta hold out strong, make sure they don't do me wrong,
Ulysses always comes through, his bravery is never new.

We gotta rep our hero, let's give a shout-out to his arrow,
It's his secret weapon, gonna take down any steppin',
It's time to get hype, don't let Ulysses fall to the tripe,
Let's show our love and support, our hero can't come up short.

So run and fetch those arrows, before those dudes get too close,
We're all rooting for you, Ulysses, you're the one we chose.

Telemachus knew just what to do,
And quickly gathered armor anew.
Four shields, eight spears, four helmets with plumes,
And swiftly sped to end their doom.

Armed to the teeth, they stood their ground,
While Ulysses took the suitors down.
His arrows ran out, but it's all good,
With a shield four hides thick, he stood.

Helmet on, with horse-hair crest,
He looked like he was on a quest.
Two spears in hand, he was ready to fight,
Defend his home with all his might.

He took 'em down one by one,
Until the battle was said and done.
The suitors fell, thick on the ground,
As Ulysses and his crew stood proud.

Yo, there's a trap door on the wall,
And an exit leading to a narrow passage, that's all.
Ulysses gave Philoetius the task to guard,
Standing by the door, he was working so hard.

Agelaus just had to shout and scream,
Thinking they could end the battle with one team,
"Just go to the trap door and we'll make a scene,
We'll stop this guy and his crazy-ass scheme!"

But Philoetius was like, "Nah, we gotta stay calm,
One person at a time, that's our bomb dot com.
We'll defend this place with vigor and charm,
And show these suitors we're not here to harm."

It's a battle to end all battles, it seems,
But with Ulysses' plan, they'll fulfill their dreams.
They'll protect their home and all of their schemes,
And make these suitors look like a bunch of memes.

Hold up, Agelaus, 
We can't let anyone cause 
Trouble at the entrance, 
We need someone with presence 
But I've got a plan, don't sweat 
I'll fetch some arms, you bet 
Ulysses and his son 
Must have stored them, I'll get 'em done

Hey-yo, check it out now,  
Melanthius is making moves, wow!  
He's sneaking through the back,  
To grab gear and give to the pack.  

Twelve shields, helmets, spears galore,  
He's getting ready for a big score.  
But Ulysses is feeling the stress,  
Seeing the suitors all armored up and looking like a mess.  

Our dude's heart is pumping with fright,  
Knowing there's danger in plain sight.  
He turns to Telemachus in haste,  
Wondering if they've been betrayed by a trusted face.  

Could it be one of the ladies that they know,  
Or Melanthius, the traitor, putting on a show?  
Ulysses is on guard and taking no chance,  
He's ready to fight and do an epic dance.

Yo pops, don't worry, it's not your fault. 
Telemachus here, the one to exalt.
I left the room open, I made the mistake.
But these thieves are the ones who should take the break.

Eumaeus, my guy, just close the door quick.
Let's see who's stealing, let's see who's the trick.
Is it one of the ladies, or maybe a dude?
I'm sus of Melanthius, he's always so shrewd.

Yo, Ulysses, don't you see?
That Melanthius is going to the armory!
The swineherd's got the scoop,
Should we make him eat chicken soup?

He's the scoundrel that we suspected,
Shall we leave him lifeless or sing him a death duet?
Shall we bring him here, to the slaughterhouse,
So that you can get your revenge, yes or no?

He's done you wrong, too many times,
So let's serve him some punishment, so divine.
I think it's your chance to flex,
And show that you're the king of this text!

Yo, Ulysses spittin' fire, 
Holdin' down those suitors with desire. 
Telemachus and he, 
Won't let them get away free. 

Now, listen to the plan he's got, 
For Melanthius, who's been quite a snot. 
Bind his hands and feet tight, 
Throw him in a store room out of sight. 

Tie a noose, oh so strong, 
And string him up all day long. 
His agony will be great, 
For causing all this hate. 

Ulysses, the king of rhyme, 
Punishing wrongdoers all the time. 
No one can mess with him, 
Or they'll end up in a room so dim. 

As the Greeks would say, "I'm shook," 
Ulysses' justice, straight outta the book. 
Melanthius won't be causing trouble no more, 
Ulysses made sure of that, that's for sure.

Oh dang, Ulysses really played,
He told his homies to put Melanthius in chains.
They caught him off guard, took him down with ease,
And tied him up painfully with a bond that won't release.

They strung him high like a pinata of old,
While Eumaeus, the swineherd, did the story unfold.
"Melanthius, man, you're in for a treat.
Sleep tight, cuz you won't be on your feet.

In the morning, you'll see the light,
And know it's time to start the goat's daily flight.
To the suitors who come here, expecting a meal,
But don't you worry, cuz we've got a deal."

The old shield he held, all rotten and frayed,
Was once carried by Laertes, at his best, he played.
But now, it lies, forgotten and old,
While Melanthius sleeps, in chains, cold. 

#NoHashtags #NoYo #NoListen

Yo, this story's about to get wild
Ulysses, our hero, is left in  bondage so vile
Those four dudes, they're fierce and full of rage
But still, the court is filled with many, brave.

Then the goddess Minerva appears,
As Mentor, she wipes away Ulysses' fears
Our hero's happy, he knows what's goin' on
Mentor's got his back, they go way back, they're both strong.

"Mentor, buddy, I need your help right now
Don't forget your old pal, don't forsake me, don't bow
You and I, we're age-mates, don't you know
Together we've fought, we've helped each other grow."

Yo, these suitors got some nerve,
Thinking they can get on this girl's last nerve.
Agelaus, you better ease up,
Or else you'll end up straight gave up.

Mentor ain't gonna side with you,
He knows Ulysses is the real hero, dude.
You threaten him with your talk of death,
But when it comes to it, you'll take your last breath. 

You plan to take everything he has,
That sounds like a complete and total gas.
But hold up, don't underestimate,
The power of Ulysses, for goodness sake.

His widow ain't gonna leave this town,
And his kids will always hold their crown.
So suitors, if you wanna play rough,
Just know Ulysses is strong enough. 

#ByeFelicia #SlayUlysses #SuitorsOutOfLuck

Yo, Minerva was mad, she didn't wanna chat,
She scolded Ulysses like a millennial brat.
She said, "Back in the day when you fought that war,
You killed so many Trojans, it was hard to keep score!

"But now you're back home, and your strength is fading,
Why aren't you fighting back? Your epicness is degrading!
Get in the game, and show these suitors who's boss,
Mentor's got your back, we'll show them who's at a loss."

Oh stop the presses, this story's getting real,
A goddess is meddling, she's making a deal,
She's testing this hero and his offspring too,
Taking the form of a bird, a swallow to be true!

With feathers so sleek and wings a-flapping,
This goddess is serious, her power's not lacking,
Perching high up on a rafter above,
Watching and waiting, gaining their love.

This is not your ordinary situation,
It's a test of mettle and determination,
The hero and his son must prove their might,
To win the goddess' favor and her delight.

Will they be successful? It's hard to say,
But this epic story has just begun its play,
With a goddess involved, things are sure to get wild,
So sit back, relax, and enjoy this adventurous style!

Yo, check it out, the suitors' plight,  
The ones with the most fight,  
Are Agelaus, Demoptolemus, and a few more,  
Still trying to make it through this war. 

Mentor failed, he couldn't brag,  
It's only a matter of time now, he's got to drag,  
Himself out of here, away he flees,  
And leaves the suitors to the hands of the wise.

Those fools stand at the doors,  
Their defenses are weak, they can't take no more,  
Don't throw your spears all at once, that's no fun,  
Six of you go first, let's make sure he's done.

Once he falls, we won't be nervous,  
We'll show them that we mean business,  
And the rest of them will fall in line,  
We'll celebrate with pizza and some wine.

Yo, Ulysses was facing suitors so wild,
Throwing spears like they were a child.
Minerva helped him dodge their aim,
Their spears were like a weak flame.

They missed the door, the post and the wall,
But Ulysses' men were ready to brawl.
He said to them, "let's give our best shot,
Or they will think we are just a dot."

Their aim was true as they threw,
The suitors had no clue what to do.
Ulysses proved to be a boss,
Beating the suitors without any loss.

Yo, this story's getting intense,
Ulysses and his squad, so immense,
Throwing spears and taking names,
Their enemies falling like a game.

Ulysses is a true hero,
Killing with precision, what a zero,
Demoptolemus couldn't survive,
Telemachus made his foe come alive.

Eumaeus and the stockman too,
Were killing their foes, feeling like they're through,
Their spears found their targets, oh so true,
Leaving their enemies to bid adieu.

As the rest of the enemy crew,
Drew back, in a corner, feeling oh so blue,
Ulysses and his men, what did they do?
They rushed forward, getting their spears anew.

Yo, the suitors came at 'em for round two
But Minerva made most their weapons go poof
One hit a post, another hit the door
While the pointed shaft simply hit the floor

But Amphimedon did manage to take
A piece of skin from Telemachus's wrist, it ain't fake
Ctesippus grazed Eumaeus on his shoulder
But the spear fell to the ground, it was all over

Ulysses and his men went in for the kill
Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus Polybus, for real
The stockman aimed for Ctesippus's chest
And said, "Heed my advice from the gods' behest

Don't talk wickedly, let heaven guide your speech
For the gods' power is far beyond our reach
I'm repaying your foot that kicked Ulysses out
So listen up bro, and don't ever pout." 

#savage #mythologybars #godlyadvice

The suitors were shook, they couldn't catch a break,
Ulysses and Telemachus slayed, no mistake.
Minerva's deadly aegis held high,
The suitors' hearts quaked, they knew they would die.

They ran to the court's farthest end,
Like cows frightened by the gadfly, no friend.
Ulysses and men struck them like vultures on the prowl,
The suitors couldn't fly or fight, they were foul.

The blood seethed, the groans were heard,
As the suitors' brains were mercilessly blurred.
It was like sport to see them fall,
Just like looking at memes on the Internet appalled.

Yo dude, Leiodes caught Ulysses by the knees 
And begged for mercy, saying pretty please 
He never wronged the women in the house, that's true 
And tried to stop the others, what more could he do? 

He was their sacrificing priest, a holy man 
If you kill him, his death would be out of hand 
Let's be real, he did nothing wrong 
And for all the good he did, he deserves a song 

So Ulysses, please be kind and spare him 
Leiodes doesn't deserve to be condemn 
He's just a chill dude, trying to do right 
Let's give him a break, yo, that's my insight. 

(Insert meme here)

Oh snap, Ulysses ain't playing no games
Dude's got a grudge, he's calling out names
He's staring his enemy dead in the eye
And telling him, "You're gonna die"

This guy wanted Ulysses to stay out of town
And marry his wifey when he was gone, he put it down
But now Ulysses is back and he's not messing around
His revenge is coming, this dude's fate is bound

Ulysses is a boss, he's standing tall
He won't let anyone get in his way at all
He's about to take this dude out for the count
With no mercy, this guy's life is done, no doubt

So if you mess with Ulysses, be prepared to pay
He's not one to mess with, so just stay away
And if you want to live to see another day
Do not cross his path, it's not worth the play. #homer #odyssey #bossup

Oh my gosh, did you just see what went down? 
This dude picked up the sword, took it and turned it around. 
He struck Leiodes so hard his head fell to the ground, 
While he was talking, like the king of the town. 

That move was so savage, it was like a TikTok trend,
Leiodes didn't even see it coming, he couldn't defend. 
He's lying in the dirt, and his journey has come to an end,
I'm shook, I'm hyped, that was a major amend. 

But seriously though, what was Leiodes thinking? 
Spitting words while his life was slowly sinking,
It's a new era now, things are escalating,
I don't even know what to think, my mind is contemplating. 

The world is moving forward, it's a whole new game,
And if you don't adapt, you'll only have yourself to blame.
The sword has spoken, it's time to claim your fame,
And if you don't, you'll end up like Leiodes, slain.

Yo, hold up, Phemius got skills!
He sings so good, it gives me chills.
But now he's stuck, in trouble deep,
'Cause Ulysses wants his head to keep.

Phemius, he's a bard so dope,
He sings for gods, gives 'em hope.
He writes his own songs every day,
And when he sings, folk gotta say:

"Damn, Phemius is killing it!"
But now Ulysses is livid
He wants to chop Phemius' head,
But Phemius begs, "Show mercy instead!"

Phemius, see, he didn't wanna be,
Singing for bozos so rowdy and free,
They made him sing or face the fire,
So he sang his heart out, no desire.

Now Phemius begs, he's on his knees,
Ulysses, man, just hear his pleas!
This minstrel's got rhymes and bars,
Don't let his death be on your memoirs.

Whoa whoa whoa, hold up pops, no need to attack!
This man's innocent, don't give him no smack.
Medon's cool too, he was tight when I was young,
He deserves a pass, let's not act dumb!

Unless Eumaeus or Philoetius beat us to the chase,
Or he ran into you when you were in a rage-filled race.
Let us not forget the kindness he showed,
Even if he's in the wrong, let's take it slow.

Yo, Telemachus was in quite the fuss,
Hiding under a seat, thinking no one would suss,
But Medon heard him, hiding like a troll,
So he popped up and grabbed Telemachus' knees like a boss, feeling bold. 

The hero of the moment, with a hide so fresh,
Medon threw it off, not even blinking, no stress.
Telemachus was caught, nothing left to hide,
But Medon was chill, no need to chide.

He knew the boy was on a tough quest,
A situation that put him to the test,
But Medon was there, ready to help,
Like a good Samaritan, a righteous whelp.

So they stood there, knee-to-knee,
The perfect duo, just wait and see,
What adventures will they face next,
But for now, they're ready to flex.

Sup dude, don't be rude,
Stop your stance, don't be crude.
Listen up, don't interrupt,
Or else you'll end up in the dump.

Let me tell ya what's the fuss,
Your dad's mad, it's just because,
These suitors have been stealing his cash,
And disrespecting you, man that's trash.

So hold up, before you act,
Tell your pops, let's keep this fact,
I'm on your side, don't need to fight,
Let's end this feud and make it right.

Yo, Ulysses is the man, no one can deny,  
He's got a plan, and he's not afraid to try.  
Telemachus saved this dude's life,  
Now he can tell the story, and end the strife.  

So, don't worry, guy, head outside,  
Avoid the slaughter and stay alive.  
With the bard in tow, just leave it be,  
Ulysses will handle it, you gotta agree.  

He's like a modern-day hero, with mad skills,  
His good deeds prosper, no time for cheap thrills.  
Telemachus is just as dope, you gotta rep him too,  
He's part of the reason we're all cheering for Ulysses' crew.  

So, let's get hype for these epic rhymes,  
And for Ulysses, who's saving lives all the time.  
With his brains and brawn, he's a legend, for real,  
And with his crew by his side, he's always gonna seal the deal.  

#NoHashtags because they're not cool,  
We'll stick to slang and memes that rule.  
Ulysses and Telemachus, a dynamic duo,  
Their deeds will be remembered, long after we all go.

Ulysses ran into the court, feeling like a boss 
His heart was beating fast, he didn't want any loss 
He sat by Jove's great altar, with his friend by his side 
They both were looking fearful, hoping they wouldn't die 

The court was silent now, the suitors' voices gone 
Ulysses searched for the men, one by one 
But he found them all lying, covered in blood 
Like fish on the beach, all gasping for their last good 

The suitors were like fish, out of their natural sea 
Each had met his demise, now they lay limp and free 
Ulysses had won, and his enemies were done 
He and his friend had emerged victorious, their victory won!

Aye aye, Ulysses, let me spout my drip
Get nurse Euryclea, this tea I must sip
This message is lowkey, for her ears only
Gonna be hella lit, but keep it strictly lonely

She needs to know a secret, that I cannot bear
It's weighing on me heavy, like a dumbbell in the air
So call her up and let her know
That Ulysses got something serious to show

This tea is piping hot, the drama cannot wait
It's time for nurse Euryclea to seal fate
So hit her up, Telemachus, with haste
This tea is too juicy to waste.

Yo, Telemachus on the grind,
Knocking on doors, calling for the assigned,
Old woman in charge, come out quick,
Papa needs to talk, don't make it sick. 

The women's room is where you'll find her, 
Hurry up before my dad loses his fervor, 
You're the boss lady, so don't make a fuss,
If you won't come out, it'll be a bust. 

Telemachus needs you to move with haste,
Like Drake said, "You gotta be quick, no time to waste,"
Your lord needs your guidance and your aid,
Don't keep him waiting, don't let him fade. 

So grab your keys and come on out,
There's no need to pout or shout,
Telemachus needs your help, that's all,
Now let's go, before the nightfall.

Oh my God, guys, listen up,
This is a story that is quite abrupt,
Euryclea came out of the women's room,
Telemachus followed, expecting doom.

Ulysses was covered in blood,
Like a lion who just ate an entire stud,
His face and clothes were messy and gross,
Euryclea was shocked, you already know those.

She was about to rejoice and cry,
But Ulysses stopped her, saying let it fly,
Don't boast about killing the dead,
It's not right, it's something to dread.

These men were a wicked and foolish lot,
Who respected no one, they were worse than snot,
But now their fate is sealed with doom,
Heaven's punishment is in full bloom.

Tell me now, woman, who is innocent,
Out of all the ladies here, who is decent,
Now spill the tea, who did wrong,
And who was singing a different song?

Yo, I'll spill the tea, my bro,
There's fifty women to know,
We train 'em all housework, true,
From wool to cooking stew.

Few of 'em have been rude,
And forgot about their manners like a fool's dude,
Not just to me but also the queen,
But they didn't mess with the son of the scene.

Telemachus wasn't on their hit list,
For he's young and still wet behind the ears, blissed,
But let me tell wifey, who's asleep amid,
Maybe some god's workings are what she has hid.

Hey, ladies, listen up and come to me,
Ulysses says to let Sleeping Beauty be.
But those who've acted out of line,
Need to face the music and fall in line.

No need to wake her just yet,
We've got some business to settle, oh you bet.
Ulysses is in charge, he's the boss,
So follow his orders without any loss.

Let's keep it chill, no need to fret,
Just be ready for whatever comes next, I bet.
And if you need some motivation or inspiration,
Remember to keep that positive vibration.

Yo, it went down in the cloister,
Ulysses came back so much moist-er.
Euryclea ran and shouted with glee,
Getting all the women to come and see.

"Stockman and swineherd, hear my call,
Take out the dead, and get to cleanin' it all.
Sponges, water, get it right,
Wash those tables and seats super tight."

After they were done, the women were led away,
To be run through with swords without any delay.
Ulysses wasn't playing, he was out for blood,
And those ladies weren't going to just show him love.

It may sound harsh, but trust in the end.
Ulysses is a hero, a real internet friend.
So raise a glass and give a cheer,
To Ulysses, the king, who had nothing to fear. 

#NotActuallyAHashtag #WhereAreTheMemesThough #UlyssesBeLitFam

Hey, hold up a minute, let me give you an update,
‘bout Ulysses and Telemachus, trying to set things straight.
In a fit of rage, they took the women in a body,
For their deeds were detestable, and their actions shoddy.

So they carried out the dead, and cleaned up the gore,
While Telemachus and his boys, did their chores.
But the women who were left, got no sympathy,
For their crimes were heavy, and their actions all stinky.

Telemachus hemmed them in, so that they could not flee,
These women who were guilty, and as insolent as can be.
They slept with the suitors, and disrespected his mom,
Their actions were despicable, and caused lots of harm.

Dang, this story's wild, you know what I mean?
This guy's got a plan, it's pretty obscene.
He ties the women up way off the ground,
So no one can save them, they can't be found.
Like birds caught in a trap, they struggle and fight,
But it's no use, it's the end of their plight.

Oh man, that's gruesome and not neat
But let me tell you what they did to Melanthius, you're gonna freak
They took him to the inner court through the cloister,
Cut off his nose, ears and drew out his vitals like a toaster

They fed his organs raw to the dogs, oh my goodness
Their fury was out of control, it's pure madness
They didn't stop there, oh no, they were on a roll
Next, they cut off his hands and feet, just like that, without toll

It's like they didn't care about his well-being
Chop, chop, slice, slice, their actions unseeing
It's like they were living in a horror movie, so scary
But I can't lie, this story is quite legendary

I hope you don't have nightmares tonight
This tale is so intense it might cause fright
But don't worry, I'll be here to hype you up
With memes and internet slang, let's raise our cups!

Yo, Ulysses be like "let's cleanse this space,
Bring me sulphur, cleanse this place!"
And he told nurse Euryclea with grace,
"Fetch fire too, let's purify this base.

Let's call Penelope and her squad,
Also all the maids, don't be flawed."
He's cleaning up like a boss, oh my god,
No wonder he's hailed as a legendary prod. 

Sulphur cleanses all the pollution,
This house now needs a purification.
Like that meme, "cleanse my soul", restoration,
In the cloisters, Ulysses is on a mission.

Now the house shines like a diamond,
No toxic vibes, he's refining.
Ulysses be chillin', wine he's wining,
Greek mythology lit, worth highlightin'.

Oh my lord, do not despair,
You deserve much better wear.
Let me bring you clean clothes,
No more rags, it's time to dispose.
Euryclea's on the task,
No need for you to even ask.
Like a true fairy godmother,
She'll make you feel like no other.
New shirt and cloak, so fresh and clean,
You'll look like a whole new king.
No more rags, that's not the vibe,
Euryclea's got you, no jibe.

Yo, Ulysses said light me a fire,
The maid obeyed, bringing it with desire.
With sulfur and flames, 
He cleansed the halls and the frames.

Then inside, the women came,
With torches and love, no one to blame.
All around, they embraced the hero,
Kissing and holding, feeling surreal, though.

Ulysses felt like crying,
His heart inside, had stopped prying.
Remembering each one of them,
The women, his people, his gem.

This moment was lit, just like a meme,
Ulysses' journey was like a stream.
Full of obstacles, twists, and turns,
But with love, he had surely learned.

Hey, hey, hey, let me tell you 'bout a tale
It's gonna make you lol, it'll never fail
There's this dude, he's like a boss
But his dance moves? Just hella loss

He thought he could floss like the rest of us
But naah dude, your skills are a total bust
He tried so hard, but in the end
All he got was a major trend

People started sharing his moves online
Got roasted so hard, it's like 2009
Even the Kermit meme couldn't compete
With how bad this guy's floss did it beat

So take some notes, young ones, to avoid being lame
Practice your moves before you become a meme game
Stay lit, fam, and keep it real
And make sure your dance moves aren't a major deal.

BOOK XXIII

Oh snap, you won't believe what's up,
Euryclea's laughing like a little pup,
Her knees are young and her feet are quick,
'Cause Ulysses is back with a nasty trick.

She heads upstairs to Penelope's room,
To share the news that'll make her zoom,
"Yo, wake up, my child, something's in sight,
And it'll make your day feel just right.

Ulysses is back, after so long,
And he's taken down the suitors - strong,
They were eating up his estate, like it's good,
But Ulysses shut them down like he should."

Oh dear Penelope, don't be so shook,
My news is true, I'm not playing hook.
You're husband's alive, he's not dead,
He's coming back, don't lay in bed.

I may sound mad, but trust my word,
Your faith in love won't go unheard.
The gods work in strange ways,
But you'll see him again in mere days.

Your sleep was sweet, but this news is sweeter,
Your husband's coming back, he's not a cheater.
I understand you may have doubts,
But trust in love, that's what life's all about.

Don't give me scolding, don't be too harsh,
Your husband's alive, he's not beneath the marsh.
Let's go and prepare for his return,
Together we'll celebrate, let the candles burn. 

I'll wait here for you, don't take too long,
Can't wait to hear you sing a love song.
So leave all worries, don't have a care,
Your husband's alive, love's still in the air. 

#PenelopeGotHerBaeBack #LoveWins #FaithInLove #HomerWho #GREEKEDOUT 🏛️🌊

Hey kiddo, don't you worry, 
I'm not here to make you hurry. 
Euryclea's telling the truth, 
About Ulysses, the one with the proof. 

It's crazy, the way they all 
Treated him, like he was just a doll. 
Telemachus had to keep quiet and sly, 
To get his revenge on those nasty guys. 

But now, Ulysses has come back home, 
To take his place on his rightful throne. 
His journey was long and far, 
But now he's back, like a superstar.

Yo, Penelope my girl, don't you worry
Our boy Odysseus came through in a hurry
He fought off the suitors like a boss
Singlehandedly, no extra loss

The nurse Euryclea, she saw it all
And now Penelope's crying, standing tall
But let me tell you, it wasn't luck
Odysseus was prepared, he didn't duck

He knew the suitors' every move
Like a gamer playing in the groove
His plan was tight, his aim was true
He hit those suitors outta the blue

So now you can breathe a sigh of relief
Your husband's back, like a total beef
No need to worry, he's here to stay
And with him, the suitors went away!

Oh dang, Euryclea, what you sayin'?
I'm keen to know what's been playin'! 
You heard them groaning, you heard the brawl?
What happened? C'mon, spill it all!

You were hiding with the women, all cloistered up
While Ulysses fought like a boss, didn't give up.
He stood over the corpses, blood and filth everywhere
Like a lion who'd just made his latest kill, totally aware.

The corpses are now in the outer court,
Ulysses even purged the house, that's worth a shout!
Girl, your man's sending for ya, callin' your name,
He's finally home, and things ain't the same.

Finally y'all can be together,
Partyin' like birds of a feather!
Your husband's back with you and your son,
And he's gonna take revenge on those who shunned.

So let's go, girl! No need to stall,
Ulysses has returned, he's the king of 'em all!
It's time to celebrate, let's get wild,
Like O-M-G, this is totally tiled!

Oh Penelope, don't be blue,
What you're sayin' just cannot be true!
It's likely the gods up above
Are angry at the suitors and their love
For evil and wickedness, they're to blame
And now they're gone, what a shame!
Ulysses is far away,
But perhaps, he'll return someday!
Don't be fooled by what you hear,
Anything can happen in a year!
Maybe it was Poseidon's vengence,
Or Zeus who gave the final sentence.
But one thing we know for sure,
The suitors messed up, that's for sure.
Now, let's hope it's not just a rumor,
And Ulysses will come home, like a true consumer!

Hold up, wait a sec, what's that you say?
Your hubby's in the house, chillin' by the hearth all day?
Don't be in disbelief, it's totally true,
And I've got proof to show to you.

When I was washin' him up, I saw a scar,
From where a wild boar had left its mark so far,
I wanted to give you the tea real quick,
But your man shut me down, hushin' my lips quick.

So why don't you come with me, and we'll strike a deal,
If I'm lyin', then you can make me feel...real pain,
But I swear on my life, I'm not playin',
Your hubby's in the house, no delaying.

So come along, let's go and see,
Your man, your love, your hubby, your G.

"Okay, boomer," I replied with a smile,
But let's go find your son, it's been a while.
The gods may work in mysterious ways,
But we'll find him, even if it takes days.

I'm totally down to see those dead bozos,
And the man who took care of their egos.
Let's hop on this search like we're on TikTok,
And get it done before the sun hits the top.

Our journey may be long and a bit rocky,
But it's worth it to see that killer's hockey.
So put on your shades and let's hit the road,
We'll find your son, and its beauty will explode.

Yo, Penelope, what's good, what's the sitch?
I see you eyeing Odysseus like he just fell off a ditch.
You're wondering if you should keep your distance or go for the hug,
But it seems like you're tripping on this man's shabby rug.

Ulysses is sitting there, looking lowkey upset,
While you're just staring at him, acting all suspenseful and set.
Girl, you gotta realize, it's your man, the king,
Telemachus is calling you out, what's with the not recognizing thing?

Come on, Penelope, don't act like a boomer,
You're a boss queen, the one and only consumer.
Step up and give your man a tight embrace,
Stop hesitating and let him see your face.

This is a moment to celebrate and bond,
No need to be acting all shy or fond.
Just show Odysseus that you still got it,
And that you'll always love and support it.

Oh my mom, you're so savage, 
Why you acting like a savage? 
Dad is back, after twenty years, 
But you're not wiping away those tears. 

You won't even sit by his side, 
What's up with that, why do you hide? 
No other woman would act like this, 
But you keep up this cold abyss. 

Your heart is as hard as a rock, 
What's going on, what's the talk? 
Why not ask dad some questions, 
And break away from these rejections? 

Let's solve this mystery, like Nancy Drew, 
So we can be like Kim and Kanye too.

Oh snap, Penelope's mind is blown
She's seeing things she thought were gone
Ulysses, her man, she thought was dead
But now he's standing there, right by her bed

She can't believe her eyes, she's in shock
Her words are lost, she can't even talk
But deep down, she knows it must be true
'Cause there are secrets that only they two knew

It's like a plot twist in a mystery show
Ulysses is back, let the people know
The ultimate comeback, like a phoenix from the ashes
Penelope sees him now, no need for glasses

This reunion is straight up legendary
Like when SpongeBob met Sandy
Or when Drake said "Started from the bottom"
Ulysses is back, he's come to rock'em

Penelope and Ulysses, a power duo
Like Kim and Kanye, or chips and queso
They'll get to know each other once again
Their love story continues, let it begin!

Yo, Telemachus, let's not get caught up in this fuss,
Your mom's trippin' cause I'm looking like I'm covered in dust.
She's testing me, making sure I'm legit,
Believing I'm someone else just cause my clothes ain't a perfect fit.

But let's move on, my dude, and think about what to do,
We just wiped out the finest youth Ithaca ever knew!
When you take a life, you gotta run from your peeps,
But with our situation, where do we even begin to creep?

Let's bounce before we get caught, hit the road and take flight,
Pray to the gods we don't end up in an endless night.
But don't worry, my bro, I got this, trust in me,
We'll find our way outta here and be free as a bee.

Yo pops, we know you're the GOAT,
The wisest of them all, that's what they quote,
Telemachus and I are ready to roll,
We'll follow your lead and achieve our goal.

They say you're the one who knows it all,
No mortal man can compare or stand tall,
We'll give it our all, our strength won't fail,
Together, as a team, we'll surely prevail.

Yo, Ulysses spittin' straight fire,
No time to dwell and mope, just retire.
First thing's first, change your attire,
Shirts on, and maids too, let's inspire.

Phemius, strike up a tune, make it lit,
The sound will ring through, make a hit,
People outside will think we're having a fit,
No talk of death, our plan will be a skit.

In the woods we'll hide, make a real choice,
Take what heaven sends, listen to its voice.
No more suitors, no more noise,
Ulysses' victory, the ultimate rejoice.

Oh dang, Phemius on the lyre
Got everybody feeling the fire
Men and women dancing with grace
This party got such a dope pace

People be talkin' 'bout the queen
Sayin' she's been gettin' mean
Not protecting her man's stuff
But let's not be too tough

Cuz Penelope's been holdin' it down
Hoping that her man will be found
So let's raise a glass to the queen
And let this lit party be seen!

Yo, Ulysses was back from the sea,
After twenty years, he's sipping tea.
Eurynome washed him up and groomed,
Minerva glammed him up, fully bloomed.

With hyacinth curls and beauty so bold,
Ulysses was godlike, we're told.
He sat down by his wife, Penelope,
She's tougher than most, a true MVP.

Ulysses said, "My dear, you're strong like a titan,
No woman could bear to hold back from fighting."
But the wife's heart was hard like steel,
Ulysses wanted a bed, a cozy deal.

"Get me a bed," he asked with poise,
"I'll sleep alone, no womanly noise."
Penelope's heart stayed strong and true,
Ulysses was back, what a hullabaloo!

Oh snap, Penelope is dropping bombs!
Not impressed by the man from whence he comes
Euryclea's getting ready to move things around
Moving the bed and all, no need to be tightly wound

Fleeces, coverlets, and blankets galore
She wants this man to rest up and not be sore
Penelope knows the power of a good snooze
She's making sure he's cozy with no option to refuse

And let's not forget about that bed
Built by the man, it's where he should lay his head
This queen knows what she's doing, oh so sly
With her wits and charm, she'll catch anyone's eye

As for the man, well he may not impress
But in Penelope's eyes, she sees the best
And with Euryclea on her team
They'll make sure he rests, like he's living a dream

Can I get an "ok boomer" for all the men who fall short?
Penelope's taking charge, giving them a retort 
She knows her worth and won't settle for less 
That's what makes her the ultimate queen, nothing but finesse.

Hold up, Ulysses ain't playin',
His wife's words have him dismayin'.
Someone moved his bed out of place,
And he's ready to pick up the pace.

Like seriously, who did this deed,
What kind of skills did they need?
It's not just any ordinary bed,
A true masterpiece, as he once said.

The post's made from an olive tree,
And trust me, it's not light as a bee.
Ulysses made it with his own hands,
And now, someone made shifting it their demands.

Did a god come down to assist,
Or is the perpetrator a skilled catalyst?
Let's be real, it's not an easy feat,
And Ulysses is not one to be beat.

He worked on it with gold and silver,
Crafted with precision, not just a shiver.
And don't even get me started on the hide,
Crimson leather, Ulysses had nothing to hide.

So, someone better 'fess up real quick,
Cause Ulysses is in detective mode, not slick.
Tell him if the bed's still in place,
Or if your guilt is written on your face.

Dang, Ulysses, you speak the truest truth
It's like you're the smartest sleuth
Penelope can't help but be overcome
Her tears flow like a never-ending hum

"Don't be mad, yo, you're the wisest guy
We've both suffered, it's made me wanna cry
We can't even be together when we're old
But I'm sorry I hugged you later, I'm not so bold"

She's been shivering with fear, so much stress
Thought someone might give her a lying "yes"
There's mad wicked people about, I'm not kiddin'
But now she trusts you, it's like you're her best kitten

Hey, Helen messed up big thanks to heaven above
She didn't even think about that sin, love
But now there's no doubt, Penelope knows
You're the only one who's seen what's under those throws

So don't trip, Ulysses, she's all in
The truth you've shown has totally won

Yo, this scene is straight outta a rom-com flick,
Ulysses and Penelope, their love is thick.
He's been gone a decade, and she's still not over it,
But now he's back, and she can't help but submit.

As they embrace, tears fall from their eyes,
Like when you're chopping onions and you can't disguise
The fact that you're crying, but it's not from sadness,
It's from pure joy, and the feeling of completeness and gladness.

Their love is like a lighthouse in a stormy sea,
A beacon of hope for all to see,
And just like sailors, lost and alone,
They find solace in the fact that they've finally come home.

Minerva, the goddess, puts a stop to their embrace,
For she knows that this scene doesn't need an encore or another take.
So she holds back the night, and keeps Dawn at bay,
Until it's time for Ulysses to start his new day. 

This reunion is sweet, like a meme that's wholesome,
Or a TikTok dance that really hits home.
Their love is epic, like a saga or a tale,
And their bond is unbreakable, like a hashtag that never fails.

Yaaas, Ulysses, that's the spirit, don't sleep on your dreams!
Your journey's still on, it seems.
Teiresias prophesied that this ain't easy street,
But don't sweat it, you're still lit and can't be beat!
Let's hit the hay now, let's get some rest,
Sleepin' like a boss will give us our best.

Yo, Penelope, you lookin' fine,  
Heard you want to know what's on my mind.  
The gods brought me back, it's true  
But now, my girl, I got work to do. 

See, I'm tasked with a quest, a mighty feat  
It's up to me to make our kingdom complete  
And though I'll tell you later, please understand  
I gotta go do this thing and take a stand. 

But don't you worry, queen so kind  
I'll be back in no time, so never mind  
Until then, get some rest, catch some Z's  
Just stay fly like the queen you please.  

And as for me, I'll be on my way  
To do this task, come what may  
So let's say our goodbyes, adios, farewell  
And catch up later, with a story to tell.

Oh dear, why you gotta press me so? 
Fine, I'll tell you, but it's a no-go. 
Teiresias told me to grab an oar,
And travel until I can't go no more.
To a land untouched by the salty waves, 
Where they don't mix salt in their raves. 
A traveler will ask if my oar's a shovel,
Which will make my journey, truly novel. 
I'll place my oar down and sacrifice beasts,
To Neptune, god of the ocean's feasts. 
Then I'll head home, and to the gods I'll pray,
With hecatombs, each and every day. 
Teiresias said I'll die by the sea,
As the waves take me to eternity. 
And when I'm old, mind at ease,
My people will bless me, everyone will appease.

Oh my gosh Penelope, you killed it!
Your lit rhyme game, I can't resist it!
Talking 'bout the gods and their fate,
But you know what they say, it's never too late.
You deserve some peace in your later days,
'Cause let's be real, life can be like a maze.
But with your strength and grace, you'll overcome,
Like that meme, "You vs. the guy she told you not to worry about," you've won!

As Ulysses and Penelope walked down the hall, 
Eurynome made sure the bed was ready for their fall. 
With torches lighting their way to rest, 
They settled in for a night of peacefulness.

The nurse left to sleep, but Eurynome stayed, 
Guiding the couple to where they'd lay. 
And as they snuggled up in their old bed, 
Joy ran through their bodies - no more feeling dread.

The men stopped dancing and told the women to cease, 
Laying down to sleep in the breezy, cool peace. 
Another night of adventure finally comes to a close, 
And our hero Ulysses can finally doze.

Oh my gosh, Penelope and Ulysses, what a pair,
Talking all night, no one else would dare.
The suitors were wicked, drinking so much wine,
Killing animals and causing a major decline.

Penelope struggled, seeing it all,
Ulysses too, his story was a long haul.
He gave the deets, every trouble he had faced,
And she listened to it all, not one detail misplaced.

They talked all night, not a wink of sleep,
Their bond growing stronger, memories to keep.
Penelope was delighted, listening to his past,
Their love so strong, it was bound to last!

My girl, let me tell you, Odysseus was the man,
who went on a journey, that no one else can.

He defeated the Cicons, oh what a feat,
then reached the Lotus-eaters, and had a tasty treat.

The Cyclops was next, with his ruthless ways,
He punished him good, it was time he paid.

He went to Aeolus, the man was kind,
but a hurricane hit, and he was in a bind.

The Laestrygonians were some mean folks,
they destroyed his ships, made it hard to cope.

Circe, the witch, was next on his list,
her magic was crafty, he couldn't resist.

He went to Hades, to talk with the dead,
he saw comrades and family, thoughts filled his head.

The Siren's singing put him in a trance,
but he escaped, and went on with his dance.

Charybdis and Scylla were a sailor's nightmare,
but he got through, with not even a scare.

His men ate the sun-god's cattle, oh how sad,
Jupiter struck them down, it was oh so bad.

Odysseus survived, all on his own,
he made it to the Ogygian island, but he still wasn't home.

Calypso, the nymph, wanted him as her groom,
but he said no, she couldn't seal the tomb.

Finally, he made it to the Phaeacians' land,
who treated him well, oh wasn't that grand.

Gold, bronze, and raiment, they gave him so much,
Odysseus, the hero, still had that final touch.

And that's the end of his tale,
his eyes began to close, like a sagacious snail.

Minerva dished out another plan,
As Ulysses rested from being a wanted man,
She asked Dawn to rise and bring light,
And illumine the world so bright.

Ulysses then sprung up from his bed,
And said to Penelope with words unsaid,
"Darling, we both faced a ton of strife,
Me, longing to come home, you, mourning my life.

Now that we're together, I need you to know,
Take care of the house, our tales will show,
And as for the goats, the suitors have taken,
I will take forceful action, no need for forsaken.

I'll take sheep by force from other lots,
Make the Achaeans fill my plots,
Now, I'm off to visit my father in the woods,
And to you, these words I've understood.

As soon as sunrise, I'll be the talk of town,
That I killed the suitors, and wore their crown,
So go upstairs, and with your ladies stay,
Ask no questions, let rumors sway."

I'm telling you, this story is tight!
Ulysses and his squad are about to take flight.
They suited up and got their armor on,
Ready to attack from dusk 'till dawn.

Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus too,
All strapped up, looking like they're about to do
Something epic, something super cool,
Something that would make a fool drool.

They blasted past the town's open gates,
Ready to unleash their fates.
It was bright outside but Minerva had the magic juice,
To make them disappear like a frantic bunny hare on the loose.

Yooooo what's up in the hizzy,
I've got a crazy story that's gonna make you dizzy.
It's all about this dude, a total chad,
Who went on a trip and things got bad.

He was heading to the beach, ready to catch some sun,
But he forgot his sunscreen, and that was no fun.
The UV rays hit him hard, his skin turned red,
He looked like a lobster, and wished he stayed in bed.

But that's not even the worst of it, my friend,
He got lost on the way back, and that's no pretend.
He wandered for hours, with no phone service or map,
He was straight-up lost, and that's a fact.

But then, out of nowhere, he heard a voice,
It was the sound of a hero, and he had no choice.
He looked up and saw a man with a majestic beard,
He was relieved, and he cheered.

The man offered to help, and led him out of the woods,
And just like that, he realized he was one of the goods.
He thanked the man and gave him a fist bump,
And in that moment, he knew he was no chump.

So the moral of the story, my squad,
Is to always be prepared, and give thanks to a mod.
And if you ever get lost, just remember,
A good samaritan might just save the day, no dismember.

BOOK XXIV

Yo peeps, let me tell you a story,  
Of the ghostly suitors, not just any ordinary.  
Mercury, holdin' up his golden wand,  
Woke up the dead by just a mere command.  

They followed him like bats in a cave,  
Whinin' and squealin', it was like a rave.  
Traversing the waters of Oceanus and Leucas rock,  
They reached the gates of dreams, what a shock.  

The meadow of asphodel, where the souls reside,  
Who couldn't work no more and thus had died.  
Their shadows loomed, it was quite a sight,  
Mercury leading the way with all his might.

Bro, let me tell you a tale so wild,
It's got the ghosts of warriors that were once styled
Achilles, the son of Peleus fierce,
Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, a man without a pierce.

These were the dudes that fought in Troy,
With bravery that we still enjoy.
Ajax stood out with his looks so fine,
And a warrior skill that would always shine.

Now they've come back as ghostly spirits,
The thought of which gives me the jitters.
But imagine dapping them up with a friendly hey,
And with these legends, spending the day.

I mean, Achilles was like the Zeus of Greeks,
Ajax was built like the Hercules physique.
And with Patroclus and Antilochus by their side,
Their history is something you can never hide.

So when you hear ghosts of warriors so grand,
Remember them, cuz they were once the hottest in the land.
#WarriorsGonnaWar #RIP #GreekMythology

The ghosts all around, it's quite a sight,
Achilles spoke up with all his might.
Agamemnon, sobbing, was filled with sorrow,
As they gathered here, in the dead of tomorrow.

The shades of Aeisthus' victims were there,
All together in the ghostly air.
In the midst of this eerie scene,
Achilles' ghost was looking quite keen.

He started off the conversation right,
"Yo, what's up guys? This is quite the sight!
Why are we all here, in this tragic state?
Is there something we need to debate?"

Agamemnon's ghost, with tears in his eyes,
Replied back, "We're all here, under these skies,
To mourn our fates and seek some closure."
Achilles nodded, "I feel your composure."

The shades gathered close, a ghostly crew,
As Achilles spoke, "I know what to do.
Let's honor the fallen and remember the dead,
And keep their memory alive, better than bread." 

So they stood there, in the afterlife,
Honoring their fallen with no strife.
With a nod of agreement, they began to depart,
Their love for each other forever in their heart.

Oh snap, yo, listen up real quick,
Apollo's speakin', he's makin' a slick
Comment 'bout Atreus' offspring, Achilles,
Said Zeus loved him best, gave him the thrill-est
Life a hero could have, all epic and stuff,
Fightin' with the Greeks, who were always tough.

But death don't discriminate, it comes for all,
Even for heroes who stand tall,
At Troy he would've been hailed, if he bit the dust,
Now no one even knows, his bones filled with rust.
Poor dude, his end was just real sad,
No montages, no hype, no one's really glad.

Yo, Peleus' offspring, you were quite savage,
Fighting at Troy, as Trojans tried to ravage,
Around your body, there were heaps of dead,
And there you lay, heedless, as the dust lead.
All day we fought, but Jove stopped our brawl,
Else we'd still be fighting, answering his call.
Once we bore you to the ship safely,
We cleansed your skin with oils rich and timely.
The Danaans were wailing, crying, and tense,
Your mother came with her nymphs, intense,
Over the waters a wail echoed so loud,
Achaeans were scared, minds jumbled, and proud.
Nestor was wise, and he calmed their fears,
"Stay, Argives, this is no reason for tears,
This is his mother, who came from the sea,
To view the body of her son, Achea, with me."

Bro, the Achaeans were shooketh no more, 
With the daughters of the old sea man who tore, 
Gathered 'round you, weeping like a pack of wolves, 
Clothed you in clothes, slicker than Uwu's fox gloves. 

The muses came through with sweet laments, 
Weeping and wailing like it was no sense,
Not one Argive didn't join in the cry,
For they felt it deeply, no need to lie.

In mourning, we spent 17 long nights, 
Weeping hot, sad tears with all our might,
But on the eighteenth day, we said goodbye,
Offering up sheep and oxen to the sky.

Cloaked in divine raiment, and honey-soaked, 
Heroes clashed their swords, leaving the ground smoked,
And when the fires of Hephaestus had done their task, 
We gathered your pure white bones without much ask.

With pure wine and ointments, we cared for you so, 
With a vase of gold gifted by Bacchus, don't you know? 
While warriors and comrades kept watch as you lay, 
Like the loss of Antilochus and Pat yearning to play.

Yo, the Argives built a tomb so fine,
To be seen on the Hellespont's line.
Your mother prayed to the gods above,
And gave prizes that the Achaeans love.

You might have seen many hero's hours,
When young men compete for sweet powers.
But nothing beats the gifts given by Thetis,
To honour you, the bravest on all lists.

Even death couldn't take away your fame, 
Your name still lives in every man's claim.
What about me? What do I gain?
Jove's wrath was my only stain.

Aegisthus and my wife did me in,
Destroyed all that I did win.
But yo, we gotta sail on, you and me,
And keep shining bright like the sun at sea.

Yo, the ghosts of suitors came with a force.
Mercury brought them through, of course.
Agamemnon and Achilles were shocked at the sight,
Seeing their killers in front of them, not feeling alright.
Agamemnon spotted Amphimedon and went to say hi,
They conversed like old friends, about Ithaca that guy.
Mercury played the role of guide,
As the ghosts talked, not fought or lied.
This meeting was lit, full of surprises galore.
But we gotta go now, can't stay no more.

Yo, what's up with you guys, tell me true - 
Why are y'all down here, what did ya do?
Seriously, you're a good-looking crew,
Why are you underground, what's the hullabaloo?

Did the sea god slap you with his wrath,
Or did enemies cross your path?
Were you lifting cattle and got in trouble,
Or fighting for wives - did it get too much to handle?

Come on, seriously, don't leave me hanging,
I was your guest, don't leave me guessing.
I remember coming to your home,
With Menelaus, wanting Ulysses to roam.

It took us forever to set sail,
Come on, guys, tell me the tale.

Yo, Agamemnon, your story is ancient,
But let me retell it, make it more vibrant.
Amphimedon's ghost has all the tea,
About how Penelope played a trick on thee.

She sewed a pall for Laertes, oh so grand,
But really, it was a cleverly crafted plan.
She pretended to work on it day and night,
But under torchlight, she unpicked it, tight.

Three years went by, and we didn't catch on,
But in the fourth, the secret was gone.
One of her maids spilled the tea to us,
Penelope had to finish the robe in a fuss.

When she was done, it shone like the moon,
But her plan to foil the suitors was much attune.
So, Agamemnon, that's the scoop,
Penelope used her needles like a boss, don't droop.

Oh my, let me tell you what happened, 
Ulysses landed on the farm with intentions so savage,
He and his son Telemachus came with a plot so malicious,
All to destroy the suitors, it was simply vicious!

Telemachus came first, then Ulysses came a-limping,
Looking like some beggar who was skin and bones, lacking,
But the suitors threw things, insulted him with no holding back,
Little did they know, their fate was sealed, they were under attack!

Ulysses and his son hid the armor out of sight,
And cunningly made Penelope give them a bow, so bright,
No one could string it, no one could nearly do so,
But Ulysses strung it with ease, his skill, they didn't know!

He sent his arrow through the iron and then,
Killed Antinous, the suitors were shaking, they were not zen,
He poured his arrows on the floor and aimed straight,
The suitors fell like dominos, there was no escape for their fate!

It was like the gods had helped him, for the suitors had no chance,
They fell upon the cloisters, like they were in some trance,
Their brains were battered, their blood was on the ground,
Their end had come, a gruesome sight to be found!

Their bodies were lying, un-cared for in Ulysses' house,
Their friends did not know, their death had caused,
So, they lay there, with their wounds, so black,
Their final moan unheard, their death so wack!

Yo Ghost Agamemnon, it's lit to see
How highly you praise Penelope
She's got the brains and the beauty so rare
That all of Greece just couldn't compare

The immortals will write a song so sweet
In Penelope's honour, it'll be a treat
So loyal to her man, she's the perfect wife
Every girl wants to live that kinda life

But Clytemnestra, she's a whole different story
She killed her hubby, it's kinda gory
She brought shame on all women, not just the bad
Now no one really wants to be like her, it's pretty sad

"Guys, we've arrived at Laertes' place, let's be slick,
Here he spends his days on this farm that's so chic,
He worked super hard to get this land looking so clean,
It's a sight for sore eyes, if you know what I mean.

His house is simple, but it's where he rests his head,
The roof is made from straw, but don't you be misled,
The slaves chill in the lean-to, after a long day,
And inside there's a Sicel woman that's here to stay.

Telemachus, let's go inside and greet Laertes,
And maybe after, we can all grab some sweet crepes,
I hope he recognizes us, our disguise is so fire,
Our threads are even sleeker than a painted up tire!"

"Yo, hit up the crib and slay the fattest swine,
While I flex on my pops with this drip so fine.
Will he recognize me after all this time?
Or will his memory be as washed up as Vine?

I'm eager to see if he's all good,
Or if he needs a refresh, like he's misunderstood.
But first, let's get that hog on the plate,
And chow down like we're running late.

So let's get this pig and make it quick,
Before someone else grabs it like a TikTok trend gone slick."

Yo, Ulysses was walking in the field,
Looking for his father who had to yield.
He saw him digging in the bed,
Wearing a goat skin cap on his head.

Ulysses stood there, started to weep,
Couldn't believe what he saw; his heart did leap.
He thought of hugging him tight,
But then, he decided to be witty and bright.

He approached his father, with a plan in mind,
To trick him before he is confined.
His dad was looking very shabby,
And Ulysses' emotions were really cabby.

He saw the hoe, the vine and the pear,
And he knew why he had to come out and dare.
He had to reclaim his rightful home,
And for that, he had to roam.

Now, Ulysses needed to act clever,
Not to reveal who he was, ever.
And he thought of a way to break the ice
And trick his dad, oh so twice.

Yo, Ulysses, my bro, you're quite the observer,
Your gardener skills are lit, like you're a master server.
Every plant, vine, flower bed, is top-notch,
Your attention to detail is just watch.

But don't get offended if I say, 
That you take better care of your crops than your own dismay.
Your clothes are old, and you unclean,
It's a sight that's quite obscene.

But it's clear as day, you're not an ordinary peasant,
Your looks suggest, that you're a noble present.
So spill the tea and tell me true, 
Whose bondman are you, and where do you pursue?

Is this place really Ithaca, so grand?
I met a guy who said it was, but he didn't understand.
He wasn't patient enough, to hear me out,
When I asked about a friend and what he's about.

My friend's name was one that he would know,
But not a chance did he give me, to help my flow.
My friend was last named Laertes, son of Arceisius,
A king's son, not some mere alias.

He visited me once, when I was home,
Out of all strangers, he was the best to roam.
He said he was from Ithaca, his homeland,
And I showered him with gifts, it was quite grand.

I gifted him talents of gold, seven to be exact,
A cup of silver, so fine with flowers that lacked,
Clothes, rugs, mantles, and shirts galore,
And four women skilled to the core.

So tell me true, oh gardener so fine,
Is this Ithaca, the land that's mine?

Oh dang, pops, it's a bummer
To hear that your son's six feet under
Your wealth of gifts won't do a thing
The wicked here don't care to sing

If you found your friend in Ithaca
He'd share his crib, no need to pack-a
But let me ask, and do be truthful
How long since your friend was youthful?

Alas, he's dead, gone, no more
Fish ate him up, a total bore
Or maybe birds, or beasts so wild
Father and mother, cries compiled

Poor Penelope, his wife so fair
No shroud to wrap, no final tear
So, spill the tea, tell us your tale
Your town, your parents and that ship's trail

Yo, lemme spill the tea,
It’s your boy, Eperitus, don’t you see?
I come from Alybas, a place so fine,
My crib’s got everything, it’s a big shine.

I’m the son of King Apheidas, oh so grand,
My grandpa’s Polypemon, a legendary man.
But heaven played me, took me off my course,
Ended up here, it wasn’t my choice, of course.

My ship is chillin’ outside of town,
It’s been 5 years, Ulysses left, he’s not around.
We saw good omens as we said goodbye,
Birds flew on our right, we both felt high.

We hoped for a friendly meeting so sweet,
With gifts for each other, a kind hearted feat.

Yo pops, don't fret, it's me, your boy    
Returned after twenty years of joy    
I see your tears, your sorrow deep    
Let me hug you tight in a loving heap    

I've been away, but now I'm back    
Ready to pick up any slack    
But we must hurry, there's no time to waste    
I've been busy at home, putting the suitor's pace    

I punished them hard, for their crimes and insolence    
They had no business usurping my residence    
Now come on, let's go, we've got to move    
There's a lot to catch up on, and so much to prove    

So let's be quick, and hit the road    
Our adventure together, will never get old    
But first, let's hug it out, and shed a tear    
For twenty years apart, is way too much to bear    

*yeehaw*

"Yo pops, don't you stress,
I'll prove I'm your son, no need to second-guess.
I'll show you my tat, see if it rings a bell,
And then we can catch up and chat and dwell.

But wait there's more, I've got a meme for you,
A Drake Hotline Bling, will that do?
And if you're still not convinced,
I'll show you my skills, no need to make sense!"

Laertes looked at Ulysses with a grin,
Impressed by his son's modern spin.
"I believe you now, my dear boy,
Welcome home, let's celebrate with joy!"

"Yo, check this out," said Ulysses with swag,
"This scar on my skin, it's no rag.
I got it hunting a giant boar,
On Mount Parnassus, it was hardcore.

You sent me to grandpa Autolycus,
For gifts promised to me, no fuss.
And in the garden, you told me about the trees,
Thirteen pear, ten apple, and forty fig, oh please!

You also gifted me fifty rows of vines,
With corn planted between, yielding juicy wines.
The grapes they produce, they are so divine,
When the heat from the sun does shine."

#NoHashtags #RhymesAllTheTime #MillennialHype #UltraCool #UlyssesGang

Laertes was at a loss, 
he heard his son's words with exhaustion and toss, 
his strength failed him, he couldn't stand,
Ulysses had to hold him with his hands.

He embraced tight, 
as Ulysses held with all his might. 
"Father Jove, the gods are still in town,"
he exclaimed with a serious frown.

The gods punished the suitors for their misdeeds, 
their insolence and foolishness had come to an end, indeed. 
But Laertes was afraid of what was to come,
he might have the townspeople bringing their drums.

All the cities in Cephallenia would be alerted,
for the news of Ithaca's betrayal had been asserted.
Laertes feared the worst, 
but his son Ulysses was there to quench his thirst.

Oh snap, Ulysses is back in the mix
No time to waste, let's get our dinner fix
He's telling his crew to head to a house nearby
To feast and chill, it's gonna be lit, don't be shy
Philoetius, Telemachus, and Eumaeus, they're all down
Cooking up some grub, like the coolest chefs in town

As they walked and talked,
Towards the house, they strolled and walked,
When they arrived they found a party,
Cutting meat and wine, living hearty.

Laertes was old, he needed some care,
The Sicel woman helped, and removed his wear and tear,
Cleaned him up and made him feel brand new,
Minerva made him taller, without any rear view.

When he returned with a glow,
Telemachus stared, and said "Oh woah!",
"You look like a god, who did this to you?",
Laertes smiled, knowing it was true.

Yo, Laertes, I totally feel ya, G
Wish you were as strong as you used to be
Grab your armor and weapons, make 'em see
That you're not someone they can easily flee

Your rule o'er the Cephallenians, such a feat
Took a fortress, Nericum, so elite
But now, with the suitors, you can't compete
Need some help, need some soldiers to meet

If you were here yesterday, all dressed
In armor, sword in hand, ready to impress
The suitors would be gone, no need to stress
And we would have thrown a party, no less

They sat down at last, and feasted with glee,
Old Dolius and his sons, and Ulysses did they see,
They stood there, amazed, at the sight of his face,
But Ulysses just watched, with a calm and cool grace.

He chowed down on some food, with a grin on his lips,
"Hey, old man, sit down, and take a few sips!"
Old Dolius just nodded, with tears in his eyes,
And said, "It's so good to see you, and hear your wise lies."

They ate and drank, with a joyous sound,
Old friends reunited, and laughter all around,
And even though they had been gone for so long,
The love between them still remained strong.

Ulysses smiled, at the end of this feast,
And said, "It's good to be back with the people I love the most, at least!"
And they all just laughed, and gave him a hug,
And said, "You're still the same, Ulysses, you old thug!"

Aye, Dolius, my dude, I'm back on my grind
And it feels so lit to be home and unwind
I'm blessed by the gods to be with my friends
And crushing these trials feels like it never ends

You ask if Penelope knows that I'm here
Nah, bro, not yet, gonna give her a cheer
First things first, I need to freshen up and chill
Then I'll surprise her with my return and fulfill

But seriously, Dolius, you the man with the plan
Always holding it down like only you can
Let's get lit and catch up on all that's gone down
And raise a glass to being back in my hometown.

"Yo, Ulysses you lit kingpin,
No need to fret, his daughter knows, it's a win-win."
He took his seat, greeted by sons, no holding back,
Hugs and high fives, they're a tight pack.
Seating arrangement sorted, Dolius the father,
These homies stick together, that's all that matters.

Can you believe the tea that's being spilled?
Rumours flowing, truth getting killed.
The suitors lost their lives, oh my!
The townsfolk gathered, asking why.

They buried each man in his place,
Sent others to their hometown's face.
All while the people gathered round,
Angry and upset, with a common sound.

Eupeithes spoke, tears in his eyes,
Said Ulysses caused all these goodbyes.
Took ships and men, now killing all,
We must act fast and give him a call.

Before he runs to Pylos or Elsewhere,
We need to show him that we care.
Or be shamed forevermore,
Let's avenge our sons who went before.

I tell you, I'm ready to fight,
Won't stop till we make it right.
Let's go, before they get too far,
Crossing over to the mainland, Ulysses leaving a scar.

All eyes were wet, for he was in strife
But Medon and Phemius arrived in the night
Podium was shook, all eyes filled with sight
Hold up, Ithaca, listen to my might

Ulysses acted under higher powers' call
Mentor by his side, who saw it all
From encouraging whispers to a vengeful brawl
The suitors' end, the god would install

"Yo, listen up, crew, don't be afraid,
I know this scene, I'm not dismayed,
I'm Halitherses, wise and true,
My knowledge will guide us through.

Past and future, I know it all,
This situation's not gonna stall,
Hold tight, fam, don't lose your heads,
We'll overcome, we won't be dead.

Trust me, I've got a hundred percent,
We'll come out of this, it's not the end,
We'll beat this thing, just wait and see,
Believe in me, trust in me.

Like that meme about a cat,
Let's be fearless, not scaredy-cats,
We'll go forth and slay this feat,
With each other, we can't be beat."

Yo, peeps of Ithaca, listen up,
This situation is a total screw-up,
You didn't heed my words, nor my mentor's voice,
And now you're dealing with some major noise.

Your sons were acting mad, going insane,
Wasting money, and causing pain,
Disrespecting the queen, thinking no one will know,
But now it's time to face the blow.

Don't take on Ulysses, don't be a fool,
Or else, you'll drown in your own pool,
So listen closely, and do what I say,
It's the only way to save the day.

Memes and slang, I got them all,
Stay away from Ulysses, or else you'll fall.

Yo, Halitherses dropped some truth bombs,
But half the crowd thought it was all wrong.
Eupeithes had a crazy idea,
To start a war, with all his peers, ya hear?

They geared up, in all their might,
Thinking they'd avenge his son's plight.
But little did they know, it wasn't destiny,
Eupeithes was about to suffer, the ultimate penalty.

He led the charge, with his head held high,
Thinking their victory was nigh.
But fate had other plans in store,
And Eupeithes' foolishness led to his downfall, for sure. 

Internet trolls and haters beware,
Don't mess with destiny, or you'll be in despair.
Halitherses spoke the truth, no doubt,
And his words shut down Eupeithes' clout.

Hold up, Minerva, don't fret
Let's talk about peace, don't you forget
Jove, you're the king, what's the plan?
Will you let the fighting expand, or stop it like a fan?

You've got the power, you're the master
Will you let the fighting go faster?
Or will you bring peace to this war
And stop this madness like never before?

Minerva's a queen, you know she's right
Let's make a truce and end this fight
So Jove, tell us what you're thinking
Will you stop this madness, or let it keep sinking?

Remember, you're the king of all
Let's end this rivalry, once and for all
So what's it going to be, let's hear it loud
Will you stop this fight and save the crowd?

Yo, Athena, why you gotta ask me?
Didn't you arrange things for Ulysses, can't you see?
Do whatever you want, but listen to me,
Here's what I think would be the most reasonable decree.

Ulysses is avenged, the suitors got what they deserved,
Now let them swear a solemn oath to keep their words.
Let Ulysses hold the throne and continue to rule,
While the others forgive and forget, don't be cruel.

They can all be friends and peace can reign supreme,
Forget the past, let go of the extreme.
No need for grudges or hate,
Let's move on and celebrate.

It's time to end this whole saga,
No more bloodshed, no more drama.
Let's live our lives with peace and love,
And thank the gods up above. #Blessed

Oh dang, here comes Minerva all eager and fast,
Darting down from Olympus, her mission unsurpassed.
She's ready to bring about something really great,
Like a boss on a mission, she won't even hesitate.

She's like the Queen B, ruling her heavenly throne,
With her goddess powers, she's not one to moan.
Minerva's got it all, brains and beauty galore,
And she's ready to show what she's truly got in store. 

So watch out mortals, she's coming for you all,
Bringing wisdom and knowledge like a boss, tall and small.
Her impact will be felt far and wide,
Just like the Drake meme, she won't be denied.

Oh snap, Ulysses got a plan to stop the foes,
He said, "Go check if they're getting close."
Dolius's son did what he was told,
And soon enough, he saw the foes unfold.

He rushed back in and said to Ulysses,
"Here they come, let's gear up with finesse."
So they put on their armour ready to fight,
Hoping to win with all their might.

Ulysses was wise, he knew what to do,
He gathered his men, strong and true.
They fought with courage, they fought with fire,
Ulysses' plan was their great desire.

In the end, they won the fight with pride,
And Dolius's sons stood side by side.
Ulysses' leadership led them to success,
This story of victory is truly blessed.

Yo, Ulysses and his crew,
Gearin' up for battle, it's what they gotta do.
Laertes and Dolius, grey hair don't care,
They're warriors now, ready to square.

They don their armour at lightning speed,
Like superheroes, they're ready to lead.
Six sons of Dolius, Ulysses and friends,
Warriors together, the fight never ends.

They open the gate, they sally forth,
Ready to conquer, victory's their worth.
Ulysses leads the way, he's got the nave,
Together they'll fight, until they're saved. 

It's lit, it's lit, the battle's on,
Millennials in armour, they're never gone.
They'll fight until the job is done,
Internet slaying, they're having fun.

Yo Telemachus, check out who's here!
Mentor's voice and form is what's near,
Jove's daughter Minerva in disguise,
Ready to offer guidance and advise.

Ulysses is pumped, happy to see,
He tells his son, filled with glee,
"A fight is coming, don't forget,
Your ancestors were tough, don't let
Them down, show your mettle and might,
Fight with all your strength and fight right."

Yo, Telemachus is straight flexin',
he ain't tryna disgrace his family, no vexin',
his dad's words are wise, truly spoken,
and to prove him right, teachin' ain't just token.

Telemachus gonna show his worth,
no fakin', no frontin', since birth,
he'll make his pops proud, that's for sure,
'cause Telemachus is not afraid to endure.

His dad's teachings will not be in vain,
he won't drown his sorrows in champagne,
Telemachus is ready to fight,
like he's powered by a Fortnite light.

So watch out world, here he comes,
Telemachus ain't no zero, he's number one,
he'll make a name for himself, just you see,
just like when y'all go viral with a new meme.

Oh my days, Laertes is on cloud nine,
He's had a stroke of luck that's divine,
His son and grandson are both super fine,
Competing in bravery, it's quite a goldmine.

Laertes must be feeling so fly,
Like a boss, and he doesn't know why,
But he's hyped up and ready to try,
Bringing positivity, no room for a sigh.

He's thinking, wow, so epic,
My fam knows how to be fantastic,
It's almost like they're incredibly elastic,
Bouncing back strong, never to be drastic.

In the words of Drake, they started from the bottom,
Now they're here, and it's hard to top 'em,
And the best part of all, we can't just stop 'em,
They're shining bright, like diamonds, on 'em.

So let's clap it up for Laertes and his team,
They're living out the dream, or so it seems,
And if anyone disagrees, they can hear Laertes scream,
"I got 99 problems, but a brave family ain't one", extreme!

Oh, Minerva, goddess of prowess and might,
Guide our hero to aim with all his might,
Poseidon's son stands before him,
But with your help, victory won't be dim.

"Son of Arceisius," Minerva spoke,
With my help, defeat him with one poke,
The blue-eyed damsel and Jove aid you,
It's time to show what you can do.

Poise your spear, ready your arm,
With this throw, we cause great harm,
Let it fly like a swift bird,
And show this foe you won't be deterred.

As you hurl that spear with might,
Let's hope it lands just right,
For as we all know, as the meme goes,
Aim for the head, and watch him decompose.

Ulysses was hyped, his spirits were high
He felt like he could take on any guy
The goddess Minerva filled him with vigor
And he sent his spear flying to trigger

It hit Eupeithes' helmet, pierced it right through
His armor clattered off as he fell askew
Telemachus and his dad continued the fight
With swords and spears, every move just right

They could have killed every enemy there
Stopped them from leaving with nary a care
But Minerva intervened, and made it clear
The time had come to stop without any fear.

Oh my lit fam, what a fright they drew,
At the voice of the goddess that they knew,
Their arms so scared, they fell on the ground,
And off to the city, they all did bound.

But Ulysses, oh he was so brave,
Like an eagle soaring, he did crave,
The son of Saturn then sent a bolt of fire,
Minerva said, "Stop, for Jove will be irate, Sire."

Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you see,
Must heed Minerva's call urgently,
Or else he'll make the mighty Jove angry,
And that's a fate too fearful to warrant a plea.

So Ulysses, oh great hero of the land,
He stopped the warful strife so grand,
And saved his men from further harm,
Thanks to Minerva's warning charm.

Yo, Minerva was like "Ulysses, listen please!"
And without hesitation, he fell to his knees.
She turned into Mentor, her voice so serene,
Creating peace between parties, she's not mean.

Mentor made a deal for them to reach,
And both groups promised to cease and desist each.
Peaceful souls we've got here, that's for sure,
Thanks to Minerva's guidance and Mentor's allure.
