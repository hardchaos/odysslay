Yo, the crew was on a mission, 
Walking down a road with precision, 
They saw a gal, lookin' like a snack, 
Fetching water with a bottle and a sack. 

They asked her who was in charge, 
Ruling this land so dang large, 
She guided them towards her dad's estate, 
But what they found was not so great. 

There lived a lady, big as a hill, 
My men were shook, standing frozen still, 
A Laestrygonian they discovered was he, 
Their hearts sank, filled with apathy.

I gotta say, Odysseus was one brave dude
But his story's wild, it's almost too much to include
He and his men stumbled upon the Laestrygonians' land
But they didn't know these ogres had a meal plan so grand

Antiphates called for the crew's demise
And his men had us saying our goodbyes
The Laestrygonians pelted with rocks with such power
Like it was all just one giant game of Tower

Odysseus, quick on his feet,
Cut his cables, and sounded the retreat
But they made it out, the only ones to survive,
Their stories to be passed down, as long as anyone can stay alive.

Yo, we sailed away
Dodged death that day
Lost some friends along the way
Arrived at Aeaean, my guy
Chilling where Circe, a goddess, resides
She's Aeetes' sis, no surprise
Both are sun's children, no lies
Docked our ship, silently
Guided by some god, undoubtedly
Stayed two nights, 'twas no brevity
On the third day, grabbed my gear
Set out to see what's near
Human encounters, or sounds to hear
Climbed a lookout so high
Saw smoke raise nearby
Thought to visit, or let it slide?
Return to my squad, I decide
Feed 'em well, and send a crew to abide.

Yo, listen up crew, gather around,
I've got a story that's sure to astound.
Lost and alone, wandering through the forest at day,
Feeling lonely and hungry on my lonesome way.
But then a god of pity came through,
Sending me a stag with antlers all brand new.
This fine creature trotted down to the river for a drink,
That's when I threw my spear and made him sink.
He lay there groaning, until he met his end,
And so I took him back, for my crew to tend.
I tied him up with rope, and carried him back,
Leaned on my spear, and followed the tracks.
When I got back to the ship, I called my men,
And cheered them up once again.
'We won't die yet, don't be glum,
We've got food now, yum yum!'
And so, we cooked that stag so fine,
Feasted on him, and drank some wine.

Yo, we was chillin' all day, eatin' and drinkin' our way,
But as the sun went down, we found a place to stay.
When Dawn appeared, I called for a team pow-wow,
"We lost, fam, no North or South, no clue where to go now."
But we can't stay stuck, gotta find a way,
We on an island, I scoped it, the sea was on display.
It's kinda low, yet there's smoke in the air,
So let's explore and see what we can uncover there. 
#LostAtSea #IslandVibes #NoDirection #CouncilTime 


As my little homies heard my voice so bright,
they were reminded of the Laestrygonian's fright,
And that ogre Polyphemus, who was full of might,
They cried tears of sorrow, oh what a plight!

But there was no use in shedding tears so wet,
So I split them into groups, without any fret,
Eurylochus got one and led his crew, no threat,
Whilst I took hold of the other, no need to fret!

Then we played a little game, off went the shot,
Using a helmet to pick the captain on the spot,
The lucky homie was Eurylochus, a winner to a dot!
He and his poor homies left and we kept the other lot. 

Both groups cried and wept, oh what a scene,
Fearing for the worst, a nightmare, a bad dream,
But we stayed strong, and avoided our fate, it seems,
Thanks to Eurylochus who led his team with esteem. 

#NotGonnaUseHashtags #CoolAssistant #RhymingGame #GenZVibes

Yo, they stumbled upon Circe's spot
Made of stone in a forest, that's hot
Wild lions and wolves were chillin' around
Under her spell, they weren't wild or bound

Instead of attacking, they wagged their tails
And rubbed their noses, without fail
My men were shook, they'd never seen
Such enchanted creatures, they were keen

To reach the goddess's house, they made their way
And heard Circe singing, like a fabulous fay
Creating a web so fine and bright
No one but a goddess could weave with might

Polites, the MVP of the crew
Said, "Let's call her and see who's who"
The singing goddess, woman or divine?
It's time to find out with a chill spine.

Yo, Odysseus and his crew,
Met Circe, wicked but true,
They entered her house, what a view,
Eurylochus was smart, he knew.

She mixed them food, cheesy and sweet,
But Circe played a poisonous feat,
She turned them into pigs, what a treat,
Odysseus cried "oh my, we are beat!"

The crew remembered their old days,
They were stuck in a piggy craze,
But Odysseus had some smart ways,
To bring them back, and end this phase.

With a little help from Hermes too,
Odysseus gave Circe a clue,
She turned them back, oh how new,
They thanked the gods, and bid adieu. 

#SorryNotSorry, Circe's ways were bad,
But it ended well, so we can be glad,
Odysseus and his crew were rad,
To escape Circe's tricks, they had.

Listen up, this story is wild,  
Our comrades were trapped, their fate defiled.  
Circe's spell had turned them all to swine,  
And they were left to wallow and whine.  

Eurylochus, our heartbroken mate,  
Returned to us in a sorry state.  
His words were lost, his tears did pour,  
We begged to know what happened before.  

He finally spoke of the pigs' sad plight,  
And how they were given acorns to bite.  
Our comrades lost in a swiney abyss,  
Their fates sealed with one Circean kiss.  

But fear not, we won't be disheartened,  
We'll find a way, leave Circe crestfallen.  
With strength and courage, we'll save our crew,  
And return home with an epic breakthrough.  

Yo, hear this epic tale that I shall spin 
About some guys who ventured in a forest within. 
They stumbled upon a sick pad made of stone
With a goddess inside who sang all alone.

The men yelled to her, called her by name
She opened the door, placed no one to blame.
The others went in thinking nothing was wrong
Except our brave protagonist who thought for too long.

He stayed behind, feeling wary and unsure
Maybe thinking the house a treasure that isnâ€™t pure.
For ages he waited, but never did they appear
Though he heard no sounds of struggle or even fear.

What could have happened in that grand domicile?
Did they succumb to the goddess and her beguiling style?
Was it a trap or just fate that's quite grim?
All we know is that no one came out of there, not even a limb.

That sword of bronze be looking fine,
I slung it on my back, no lie.
I grabbed my bow, ready to go,
And told Eurylochus, let's hit the road.

But homie held me tight, so scared,
Saying, "Please don't go, we can't prepare.
You won't come back, let's stay alive,
Let's escape with the rest, let's survive."

I looked at him, shook my head,
"I gotta go or we'll end up dead.
I'll bring back the lost, just wait and see,
But if not, at least I'll die free."

Eurylochus looked at me with doubt,
But I had to go, there was no way out.
So I left him there, uncertain of our fate,
And ventured out, with courage, not hate.

Oh no, don't be a clown.
Let's get hyped and shake this town!
While you feast on your ship with foods so fine,
I gotta go cause it's my time to shine.

I won't sit here and let opportunities slip,
I'll work hard and make that money flip.
So, you vibing in your cozy home,
While I go out, hustle and roam.

Peace out now, see you later,
Gonna go chase my dreams, be my own creator.
You sit tight, eat and drink and chill,
While I go out, do the work and thrill.

Yo, listen up, my dude, it's time to hype your trip,
As you wander through the grove with that ship-wrecked grip,
Mercury peeks through, looking youthful and lit,
Like a teenage dream with his golden wand fit.

He tells you straight up, you're in a bad way,
Your men are trapped, Circe's turned them into swine, no way!
But fear not, my friend, there's no need to be shy,
Just take this herb, and give Circe a try.

It's a talisman, dude, trust me, it's true,
No mischief can touch you, no way to get screwed,
So head to the enchantress, with confidence high,
And see if you can free your boys from that sty.

Yo, listen up, I'll tell a dope tale
Of Circe and her wicked witchcraft fail
She'll mix a brew with drugs to make you trip
But fear not, with a herb, you'll give her the slip

When she waves her wand, you gotta be quick
Draw your sword and make her think she'll get a stab or a nick
It'll make her scared, she'll want to get laid
But don't reject her, you need your friends to be saved

She must swear and promise to not be a baddie
Or else she'll strip you naked, and you'll be sad-dy
So be smart, get her word and save the day
And don't forget, live, laugh, love, and slay!

Oh my gosh, hold up, wait a minute,
Let me hop on this story, let's begin it.
He pulled out a herb from the ground,
Black roots and white flowers, what did he have found?

The gods call it Moly, a plant so divine,
Mortal men can't touch it, that's just the line.
But the gods can do whatever they please,
Guess they've got the keys to all the treas.

This tale's got me hooked, can't you see?
What else happened, please tell me.
Did he use the herb for something grand?
Or was it just a plot, a mere strand?

I need to know, I won't rest,
Until I hear what happened next.
So come on now, let's not stall,
Tell me more, spill the tea on this appall.

Whoa, hold up, what's this I hear?
About a hero with a tale to share, let's cheer!
Odysseus is the man, with a heart full of care,
Walking on to Circe's house, with a burden tough to bear.

He calls out for Circe, and she opens up the door,
Invites him inside and asks him to explore.
Her house is fancy, decorated with silver,
A footstool for his feet, and a goblet to deliver.

But wait, hold on, did I hear that right?
She drugged his drink, with all her might?
She had a plan, for him to fall,
But Odysseus didn't feel the charm at all.

Circe then struck him with her wand,
Said "Off to the pigsty, go make your bond."
Odysseus had no choice, but to go with the flow,
And make his lair with pigs in tow. 

Like the meme says, ain't nobody got time for that,
Odysseus knew it, time to put on his thinking hat.
He'll come back strong, like a boss in control,
And show Circe who's the hero, and who's on patrol.

Hold up, hold up, hold up tight,
You telling me she gave you a little bite,
Said she put some herbs in your drink,
Thought you would pass out and your senses would sink?

But you came like a champ, didn't even blink,
She clung to your legs and began to think,
Who are you, where'd you come from, tell me the truth,
There's no way my drugs didn't leave you uncouth.

But you were spell-proof, like an OG,
With a resistance that was downright crazy,
So she thought, could you be the one and only,
Ulysses, who's always roaming?

You know what that means, time to be friends,
Let's hit the sheets and let the trust begin to blend.

Whoa, hold up, Odysseus, you dealing with Circe's fuss,
She's trying to turn you to mush, boy, you better hush.
No way you can trust her, telling you to hop in her bed,
She'll ruin your manhood, leave you feeling half-dead.

You gotta be straight up with her, gotta tell her the truth,
No need to beat around the bush, be your own sleuth.
She got your men looking like swine, that ain't no joke,
Man, that's so uncool, it's making me want to choke.

So tell her, Odysseus, that you won't fall for her spell,
That you won't be another dude she can easily quell.
Make her promise not to cause harm, cross your heart and hope to die,
Or else you'll take your leave, and soar up to the sky.

Yo what's up, let me tell you 'bout this crazy stuff,
This girl took an oath and it was far from enough,
But when she swore like a boss and gave it her best,
Well that's when I knew we'd pass this ultimate test.

We snuggled up tight, I could feel the heat,
Our chemistry was lit, it was hard to beat,
I knew in that moment, everything was just right,
It felt like the stars aligned that very night.

I can't even lie, this was an epic score,
It had me feeling like I couldn't ask for more,
So remember folks, sometimes it's best to play it bold,
And you might just end up with a story that's told.

Ok let me translate this into terms that are lit,
So Circe's got four servants, decked out with pure wit.
They're the offspring of the groves and holy water,
Their housemaid duties, they don't bother to falter.
One laid a purple cloth, with a carpet beneath,
It's already looking like a feast fit for a sheath.
Now another brought in tables of shining silver,
Filled with gold baskets of food that truly deliver.
A third servant mixed water and wine, a great combo,
Poured them in cups of gold, the perfect duo.
The fourth one started boiling water for a bath so hot,
Hey, at least it'll clear your mind and shake off that distraught. 
Set in the bath, they scrubbed the tire and stiffness out,
Then dressed you up, so fly, no sign of any doubt.
A golden ewer came pouring water in a silver basin,
So you could clean your hands before tasting any raisin.
Maid servants were there constantly serving food,
But you were still in a mood, with a bad attitude.
Circe offers you food, but you decline with suspicion,
Next chapter might show if that's a clever decision.

Yo, Circe saw Ulysses lookin' bleak 
Not eatin' food or drink, he looked so weak 
But she came thru and asked him why 
He was sitting there just like a guy 
With no voice gnawin' at his heart 
But Ulysses still doubted from the start 
Even though Circe swore an oath 
He still had his doubts, you see, no joke 
But Circe wasn't playin', she was legit 
She wouldn't hurt him, not a bit

Oh dang, Odysseus speaking truth so bold,
With Circe in his face, he's feeling so cold.
He's like, "Sorry, girl, but we can't kick it here,
Until you let my homies be free and appear."

He's not down to feast until his crew is safe,
Odysseus ain't no fool, avoiding this potential grave.
Circe's got some magic, but he's not fooled,
He knows she won't get his loyalty so easily wooed.

He's gotta see them with his own eyes, that's for sure,
Odysseus knows his crew, he needs to check and make sure,
They're not all ghosts or pigs, known to Circe's spells,
He'll make sure they're all there, ringing her ancient doorbells.

Gurl, when she spoke, she meant biz,
Went straight to the court to fix
The spell she cast took away the curse,
Turned the men back to men from pigs, no worse.

They were lookin' fine, no piggy snout,
Taller, younger, with more clout.
My men recognized me, oh how they wept,
Circe saw and told me what to expect.

"Ulysses, my man, go back to the bay,
Bring back yo' ship, and do it today.
Hide yo' gear, keep it safe and sound,
And come back here with the squad you've found."

Heyo, I went back, all alone,
And the men were crying, just like I've known.
I sauntered up to the ship, so neat,
And they were hurtin', oh so deep.

The blubbering crew sprang up so quick,
Dancing around like little chicks.
It was like they'd gone back to their Ithaca's isle,
And were playin' with grinning-slobbering smiles.

"Yo, we're so happy to see you now,
It's like we're all back again, holy cow!"
But they begged, and pleaded, quite a lot,
"For word of our mates, tell us what you've got!"

So I stood tall, and picked my words with care,
I tried to give them the news, gentle and fair.
I explained just what had gone down,
And why their friends couldn't be found around.

Hey fam, listen up quick,
Our ship's gear we need to hide, that's the trick,
We gotta stash it in some secret cave,
Then head to Circe's, and our comrades save.

I know it's tough, but we gotta move fast,
Our friends are chillin' while we're stuck in the past,
We gotta join them and catch up quick,
And indulge in abundance that's pretty sick.

So let's be smart and strategize,
Hide our stuff and be super sly,
We'll get to Circe's in no time flat,
And be reunited, just like that!

Oh snap, the men were ready to depart,
But Eurylochus had some smart
Words to say, warning of Circe's charm,
And her potential pig/wolf/lion farm.

He cautioned all, "Don't rush to her place,
Remember the Cyclops and his scary face.
Ulysses' comrades went in and died,
Don't let our recklessness be our demise."

Eurylochus' words spoke the truth,
In the face of danger, we need some proof
That Circe won't turn us to beasts,
With no control, and no release.

Let's learn from the past and be smart, 
And not fall victim to Circe's dark art.
Stay cautious and stick to the plan,
Or we'll end up as swine at her command.

Oh dang, when I heard his spiel
I was ready to bust out my steel
But my crewmates stepped in
And said let's not be too grim

This guy can hang and stay on the boat
While we go and see Circe, she's the goat
We'll all have mad fun
And this guy can keep guard like a son

So we left him behind
And trust me, we didn't mind
Circe's house was lit, no cap
We partied hard, drank and napped.

Oh snap, we went all-inland,
Eurylochus didn't stay behind, he joined our band,
That dude was scared, my reprimand was too much to stand. 
But now we're together, exploring the land. 

No FOMO here, we stick together like glue, 
Our squad is lit, what we do is true,
Can't leave anyone behind, it's just not cool.
Eurylochus found out, our friendship is the rule. 

We keep it real, our bond is tight,
Adventuring on this island, everything is just right.
Eurylochus learned, being left out is not the height,
Of our friendship, we include everyone in our sight. 

So let's go crew, let's explore and have some fun,
Our journey has just begun,
No more fear, no more undone,
Our camaraderie, a force to be reckoned son!

Yo, yo, yo, Circe's house is fresh indeed,
Her hospitality's what my crew did need,
She hooked them up with olive oil and clothes,
Now they're eating good and forgot their woes.

When they saw each other, tears began to pour,
Joyful and thankful, they couldn't help but roar,
Circe told me to chill out and let them feast,
Get back on their feet and forget the beast.

My crew's spirits are down, their bodies weak,
They can't get the strength they need to speak,
But Circe saw all that and knew what to do,
Get them fed, get them hype, and give them some woo.

Thanks to her, I'm feeling like a king,
With her hospitality, life has a ding,
So let's enjoy the food, the drink, the cheer,
The world is waiting for us, let's give a cheer!

"Yo, Odysseus, your squad's right,
It's time to fly like a kite.
Your crew's been here for a year,
Feasting hard, no need to fear.

With Circe's blessings, we've been fed,
Now it's time to go ahead.
No offense to the goddess fine,
But it's time to cross the line.

Gotta get back to Ithaca,
With a speed like a Mazda.
Penelope awaits at home,
And suitors she's got to comb.

So let's hit the road like a boss,
Let the journey be lit like sauce.
With you at the helm, we'll be fine,
And reach home like a glass of wine."

AYYY, listen up, peeps, it's time for some Greek myth tips!
Odysseus was on Circe's island, eating meat and drinking wine so divine,
But as the sun descended, his men went to bed in the covered confine.
Odysseus, though, had plans with Circe still in mind, so divine.

He got on his knees and begged her plee,
Said, "Circe, my dear, can you aid this weary sea?
My men and I are ready to leave and go back to our place,
Their moaning is relentless, constant, and they're always in my face."

Odysseus wanted to go home, so he pled his case,
He wanted to leave the island and get back to the right space.
Will Circe help him? What do you think? I'll give you a hint, 
She's a goddess, so be prepared for some divine intervention, which is stinkin' mint!

Yooo Ulysses, son of Laertes, don't you know,
Your journey ain't over, there's a place to go.
You gotta cruise to Hades, and talk to the dead,
Teiresias, blind prophet, is who you gonna be led.

He's got all the answers, he's still got his smarts,
Even in death, he knows all the parts.
Proserpine left him his wits, so he's still got that clout,
Other ghosts just flit about, no idea what they're about.

So pack your bags, get ready to sail,
To Hades you go, where the ghosts prevail.
Teiresias is waiting, with his insight bright,
Get ready to hear his words, bringing you the light.

Oh dang, this story's got me shook,
Our protagonist's fate is sounding like no joke,
He's weeping in bed, not wanting to see the light,
Thinking about Hades, oh what a fright!

But wait! Hold up! This ain't the end,
Our hero's got fight left, let's comprehend,
He wonders who will guide him through these trials,
Through the dreaded port of Hades, no one's styles!

I sense some bravery in our man,
He's not ready to end his life's span,
He knows the journey ahead won't be fun,
But he's down to fight it, until it's done.

Maybe he should call on some Greek gods,
Get some help, avoid all the odds,
But for now, let's just hope he's strong enough,
To get through Hades' difficult stuff. 

#NoHashtags #NoYO #AgeOfTheInternet #RhymeTime #HadesIsABeast #GreekMythology #LetsGetLit #ModernDayTales #FollowMe #MemeQueen #YasssKween #Facts #StayCool #WordUp #WeGonnaSlam

Okay, okay, hold up tight,
I've got a story that's outta sight!
Listen up, sailors, I've got the key,
To a journey beyond the deep blue sea.

So raise your mast and set your sails white,
And the North Wind will take you out of sight.
As you cross the waters of Oceanus,
You'll reach Proserpine's groves, it's a must!

Tall poplars and willows you'll see,
That shed their fruit oh so untimely.
Beach your ship upon Oceanus' shore,
And make your way to Hades' door.

This place is near two rivers that roar,
Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus, in case you wasn't sure.
They both flow into Acheron, that's no lie,
And there's a big rock where they meet and collide.

Just past that is the dark abode of Hades,
Be careful not to get lost in those shady alleys.
That's where you'll need to get to, my friend,
And bring back what you seek, the journey's end. 

Now let me hit you with a meme,
To make sure you don't stop like a broken machine.
So listen up, this journey's the real deal,
It'll take courage and power, it's not for the feels.

"Yo listen up, let me tell you a tale, 
About a dude who found himself at the gate of Hades' jail.
He dug a trench, poured honey, milk and wine,
Sacrificed a heifer and promised, 'This is fine.'
To the ghosts, he promised a feast so wild,
And a black sheep to the wise Teiresias in style.
And oh, don't forget to pray and beg,
For the dead and their sad unending dread." 
#RIPtoGhosts #PourOneOut #HeiferSacrifices #TeiresiasTheSheepish #BeggingForLove

Yo ghost man, listen up, 
I got a plan that won't make you throw up. 
First, pray and bend those heads, 
And offer up that ram and ewe to the deads. 

Make like you're leaving but watch them close, 
Ghosts will come, and they will boast. 
Then tell your men to skin those sheep, 
And offer them as sacrifice- it's not cheap! 

Pray to Hades and to Proserpine, 
And before you know it, it'll be your time 
To ask Teiresias your burning questions 
Of your voyage, and any life lessons. 

So stay seated with your sword in hand, 
And don't let any ghostly dude take a stand. 
The seer will come and guide your way, 
To reach your home, you'll need to sail the sea all day!

Ayy, dawn was breakin', and the queen was talkin'
She threw on some clothes, no time for walkin'
I was dressed in a shirt and cloak, ready to leave
She put on a mantle, like a boss, oh please
I talked to each man, kind words for all
We can't stay here, gotta heed the call
Circe spilled the tea, we gotta bounce
No time for sleepin', let's get out of this house.

Epic tales, gotta tell you one more,
But Elpenorâ€™s fate, it's quite a snore.
This lad, too much drink he did ingest, 
Laid on a roof, trying to take a rest.
The noise of his crew did wake him up,
He stumbled, disoriented, like a lost pup.
Elpenor forgot, on the roof he stood, 
And fell to his death, quite the dud.
His soul did leave, went down to Hades,
Rest in peace, my thoughts and my prayers.

Oh snap, it was time to rap
As Odysseus gathered his crew, kinda whack
He said, "listen up y'all, we gotta change track
Circe says we gotta hit up Hades, how 'bout that?

To the house of death, we gotta go
Speak to Teiresias, let his wisdom flow
Proserpine's there too, don't ya know?
Gotta consult the dead, no time to be slow

I know we all wanna head back west
But we gotta handle this haunted quest
Circe's got it all under control, she's the best
Trust me crew, we'll come out of this blessed"

Oh my gosh, these dudes were so sad, 
they fell to the ground and acted mad. 
Tearing hair and crying didn't do much, 
Circe's spell had hit them like a punch. 

We made it to the shore, full of sorrow, 
Wishing for a brighter tomorrow. 
That's when Circe brought the animals by, 
And we fastened them, not questioning why. 

She slipped by, unseen by us mortals, 
A deity with powers like portals. 
Can't see a god if they don't want to be spotted, 
So the fact that we missed her can't be plotted.

Hey, what's up, my fellow cool kids in the house?
Got a wild story that's gonna make you say "wow!"
We're talking drama, suspense, and all that jazz,
So sit tight and get ready to be amazed!

This story is gonna be lit, no cap,
It's got more twists and turns than a Snapchat map.
We're talking plot twists that'll make your jaw drop,
And characters that'll make you wanna bop.

Picture this: a group of teens on a mission,
To uncover a secret that's causing suspicion.
They gotta use their wits and their tech-savvy skills,
To solve this mystery and pay all the bills.

Now, let me just say, this ain't no basic tale.
We're talking high stakes, like a game of Fortnite or Jail.
There's betrayal, romance, and lots of action,
So keep your chill, or you'll be a distraction.

In the end, our heroes come out on top,
Like a squad in Among Us who never flop.
They save the day and get the ultimate glory,
Just like when you get that Victory Royale in Fortnite, so-called "mandatory".

So there you have it, a story to remember,
Full of humor, fun, and lots of adventure.
Thanks for tuning in and being so rad,
We're outta here, like a trending meme that's just a fad.

BOOK XI

Listen up, our story is about to begin,
We're on a journey, things are getting thin,
We pulled our ship into the sea,
Feeling sad, not where we want to be.

Circe, a goddess, came to our aid,
A fair wind, we were no longer afraid,
Our sails filled up as we went on our way,
Tending to the ship, our hearts led astray.

All day long, we sailed through the waves,
Our destination, a place full of haze,
The Cimmerians, where the sun doesn't shine,
Enshrouded in mist, a melancholy sign.

We arrived, took the ship out of reach,
The sheep came with us, onto the beach,
Longing to see the place that we had heard,
A mysterious location, known by word.

Circe had told us what to expect,
A journey we won't soon forget,
Where the land is covered in gloomy mist,
Our adventure, an unforgettable twist.

Yo, listen up, here's the deal
Odysseus had to make a meal
For the ghosts that came from Erebus,
Brides, young bachelors, and those who lost love thus

He set up a trench, a cubit all around
Then drew his sword, and plunged it in the ground
Libations were made with milk, wine, and water too,
He promised the dead a heifer and a sheep that's black as a coo

When the prayers were done, two sheep were killed
The ghosts came screaming, round and chilled
Odysseus and his crew did their best
Flaying the sheep and burning a request

The King of Ithaca had some queries for Teiresias
Thus he sat with his sword drawn out of fear-as
No ghost dared come near till answers were had
And Teiresias' prophecy outweighed the terrible death that Odin once had

Yo, Odysseus told a tale, 
About a ghost that made him pale, 
Elpenor, his comrade dear, 
Who died and left his body here. 

Odysseus, full of regret and sorrow, 
Saw him in the underworld, no tomorrow, 
He cried when he saw his old friend, 
How'd Elpenor's life come to an end? 

But before he could answer, 
Odysseus heard a noise like thunder, 
It was Cerberus, the three-headed dog, 
Who guarded Hades like a bossy hog. 

Odysseus had to flee, 
Or else he'd be a goner, you see, 
But he promised to bury his friend, 
And bring his journey to an end. 

So, let's learn from Odysseus' journey, 
And don't forget your friends, top attorney, 
Or else, just like Elpenor, 
You might end up in the underworld's horror.

Yo, Odysseus was in a tough spot,
His shipmates were dying, one by one, a lot.
Then he met Elpenor, who groaned and moaned,
And told him a story that left Odysseus stunned.

He fell off Circe's house, while he was sleep,
Broke his neck and landed in Hades, so deep.
Odysseus was shook, but Elpenor didn't stop,
He begged, 'Bro, you gotta make it right and not take off.'

Elpenor's boys were counting on him,
His wife, his father, and Telemachus grim.
If he left Elpenor to rot and decay,
He would face the wrath of the gods, is what he had to say.

Odysseus, being the man that he is,
Agreed to give him the burial he missed,
He would burn him with his armour and make a grave,
With Elpenor's oar planted, his memory saved.

Yo, we sat there feeling blue,
With my sword over the goo,
My comrade's ghost telling tales,
From the other side with some wails.

Then suddenly, my mom's spirit appears,
Anticlea, with Autolycus' cheers,
I left her breathing before Troy,
Moved to tears, I couldn't be coy.

But I kept her from the blood she fears,
Until Teiresias could answer my snears.

Oh snap, it's the ghost of Theban Teiresias!
With a golden sceptre, he approaches us.
"Yo, Ulysses, son of Laertes, why you here man?
Leaving the light of day for this ghostly land?"
He tells us to back up and put our sword away,
So he can answer our questions in the dopest way.

Oh my gosh, let me tell you the story 
Of a man who tasted blood, oh so gory 
He drank it up like it was an iced coffee 
And then started spitting some prophecy 
I swear, my heart was beating like it was on fleek 
As he spoke like he just learned how to yeet

"Yo, this is one hell of a wild story, 
But let me break it down with some Gen-Z glory.
So, you want to go back home, sounds like a plan,
But hold up, Neptune's anger ain't a thing so grand. 

If you recall, you blinded his son,
Now you gotta pay, and it won't be fun.
But you can make it back, just play it cool,
And don't mess with the sun's sheep or you'll play the fool.

These animals are sacred, they belong to the light,
So if they get hurt, it'll end in a fight.
But if you keep your eyes on the prize,
You may make it home, despite the many lies.

But don't get too happy, don't pop the champagne,
There's still some challenges, still some pain.
Your house will be invaded by those who seek your wealth,
And your wife, she's not immune to their sneaky stealth.

So hold tight and stay strong, for this journey is long,
And just remember, your fate is never set in stone."

Sup, sup, it's your assistant bringing the rhymes  
Gonna hype up a tale from ancient times  
A hero named Odysseus on a quest  
He's gonna get vengeance and that's the best  

He'll take down suitors with force or deceit  
Then hit the ocean, his plan can't be beat  
A well-made oar and a country unknown  
No salt, no ships, this place is his home  

A winnowing shovel he'll have on his back  
A wayfarer will confirm, no chance to backtrack  
He'll plant the oar and make a sacrifice  
A ram, a bull and a boar, it will be nice.  

Then head on home and offer to gods  
One after the other, sounds like a good job  
Odysseus is gonna live to an old age  
Until the waves take him, that's his next stage.  

Yo, I hope you liked this ancient tale  
Odysseus, he's about to set sail  
Your assistant signing off, gotta be true  
Just do it like Nike, that's all you gotta do.

Oh dang, that's heavy stuff,   
Your poor mom's ghost looks rough.  
You want her to speak to you true,  
What can you do, what can you do?  

Maybe you can try to remind her  
Of memories that've been a blur.  
Something that'll jog her brain,  
And bring back memories of her pain.  

But be careful, it's no easy feat,  
Talking to ghosts on the street.  
You gotta be brave, gotta be bold,  
And never ever let your fear take hold.  

So take a deep breath and relax,  
And think of memories that'll bring her back.  
With your love and your soul that's true,  
You'll make her remember and know you.  

Just remember, don't give in to fear,  
And you'll make her memory crystal clear.  
Go and talk to her, don't be shy,  
And you'll be amazed at her reply.  

To quote a meme, 'You got this!'  
Go and give it your best, no miss.  
And if all else fails, just know,  
Your mom loves you, that's for sure, bro.

Oh my gosh, there's a ghost in the mix
But with some blood, we'll get our kicks
Chatty ghosts? Never thought I'd see
Good thing this one's down to spill the tea!
No blood for them, and they'll bounce quick
But with some sips, they'll do the trick 
I think we're about to summon the dead
This ghost is about to spill what's been unsaid!

As Teiresias ghostly predictions took flight,
I sat and pondered, in the dead of the light,
When my mother arrived, things started to brighten,
Her love felt like sunshine, no more it would lighten.

"My child, in this world that's so bleak and unreal,
How did you get here, how did you feel?
These waters are treacherous, so you must be wise,
The journey home is long, with sad goodbyes.

Are you still trying to get back, my dear boy?
The one to whom you're married, the one with such joy?
The land of Ithaca is where you should be,
Your wife, your true love, is waiting for thee."

Yo, Mom, it's me, your boy Odysseus,
Trying to talk to Teiresias, it's really serious.
I've been through a lot since leaving Achaea,
Lots of misfortunes, it's like I'm cursed, ya dig, playa?

But tell me, Mom, how did you die?
Was it a slow burn or a quick goodbye?
And what of my father and son, my legacy?
Is my estate secure or did some fool get the best of me?

What's my wife doing, Mom, is she holding it down?
Or did she run off with some other clown?
Tell me true, Mom, I need to know,
I've been gone so long, it's like I'm a ghost, a no-show.

Dang yo, Odysseus's mom is for real,
Telling him how much his fam has to feel,
His wife can't stop crying, it's such a mess,
And Telemachus is handling things with such finesse.

The lands are still his, no one can take,
And Telemachus is living like he's fake,
Partying like crazy, he's quite the host,
Getting invites from everyone, coast to coast.

Odysseus's dad remains in the country,
No comfy bed or bedding, it's kinda funky,
Sleeping on the floor in front of the fire,
Going about in rags, man that's dire.

He grieves constantly, feeling older,
Wishing Odysseus was back, his heart colder,
But that's not all, his mom takes a bow,
Dying from a longing, it's heavy now. 

Heaven didn't take her easily, with no pain,
Her affection for her son was the death of the dame,
Odysseus must feel so much guilt by now,
This whole situation is a BIG wow.

Yo, as I tried to embrace my mom's ghost
I felt like it was just a roast
Thrice I tried to grab her, but she was just a dream
It felt like a nightmare, or so it seemed
"Mom, why do you keep flitting away?
Can't you just stay for a second, come what may?"
I just wanted to hug her in the house of Hades
But instead, I'm haunted by these sad shades

Oh dang, poor dude, your fate is so messed,
Proserpine ain't playing, you've been falsely addressed,
But don't you worry, it's not just her game,
When people pass on, things ain't quite the same.

The flesh and bones that used to hold,
A soul so bold, now mercilessly fold,
And flames consume what's left, it's true,
The soul takes off, like a dream, from view.

But hey, head back to the land of light,
Take note, my dude, of this eerie sight,
So you can tell the wife you love so tight,
And together face death's looming, scary height. 

(Side note: Did someone say "Proserpine"? Reminds me of Persephone, Queen of the Underworld. #GreekMyths #HadesGang)

Yo, let me tell you what went down,
When Odysseus talked to the ghosts in Hades' town.
Proserpine sent the wives and daughters of all the greats,
And they crowded the blood like it was their fate.

Odysseus had a plan, smart and bold,
He drew his blade and the story did unfold.
He questioned each ghost, one by one,
Their lineage, race, and all that they had done.

The shades of the famous women were there,
From past queens to princesses fair.
Odysseus talked to them, he was wise,
He listened to their stories, no need for lies.

That's how he learned about their legacy,
From the wives and daughters of the greats, you see.
It was an adventure for Odysseus to behold,
When he met the ghosts and their stories were told.

Yo, let me tell ya bout this girl Tyro,
She fell for this river named Enipeus, don't ya know.
She walked with him along the riverbed,
But then Neptune disguised as her guy swooped in instead.

Under a wave blue as a mountain,
The god took her virgin girdle like a fountain.
Tyro slept deeply as Neptune made love,
And then he said, "Take care of these babies, Tyro, my dove."

Neptune revealed his real identity,
And told her to keep it with confidentiality.
He predicted twin babies she'd surely birth,
And said no more, returning her to earth.

Ok, ok, so check it, here's the deal,
With this story I'm 'bout to reveal,
Once upon a time, in the deep blue sea,
A dude took a dive, believe you me!

And his girl, she gave birth to sons,
Pelias and Neleus, they were the ones,
Both of 'em served Jove, king of the skies,
They gave it their all, no compromise.

Pelias was a sheep breeder, Iolcus his abode,
While Neleus lived in Pylos, his story unfold,
More kids were born to that lady fair,
Cretheus' sons, mighty warriors, beware!

With Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon's might,
They rode their chariots and fought their fight,
So listen up 'cause this story's tight,
A tale of heroes and their epic might!

Oh dang, let me tell you a tale
About Antiope, who didn't just prevail
Daughter of Asopus, she was one fine female
Slept with Jove himself, to her sons let's get into detail

Amphion and Zethus, those were the lads
Built Thebes so strong, no one made them sad
Seven gates and a wall, they did it all
But without Thebes standing, their efforts would've been small

Antiope knew the way, she led them right
With Jove's help, her sons won the fight
Now Thebes stands tall, against any plight
Thanks to this queen, who made everything bright

#MythologyGoals #JoveIsBae #SevenGatesLitty #AntiopeTheQueen

Yo, let me tell you 'bout these ladies I've seen
Alcmena and Megara, they're oh so keen
One's the wife of Amphitryon, with Hercules divine
The other the daughter of Creon, Amphitryon's son's wife to dine

Alcmena, she's got that godly child
Hercules, he's strong, wild, and wilder
Megara, she's a queen of great land
Her husband's strengths, tough to understand

These women, they're strong and fierce
Their stories are just too lit to pierce
From mythology that we all know
To the pages of history that forever glow

"Okay, stop right there, let me make it clear,
The story you're about to hear, will leave you in fear.
It's about Epicaste, whose fate was blast,
She married her own son, but it didn't last.

Oedipus killed his father like it was no struggle,
His own momma didn't know he was in trouble.
The gods brought it out into the open,
And poor Epicaste just couldn't cope then.

She hanged herself, it's crazy to see,
And avenging spirits haunted Oedipus after she's free.
His life was ruined, he was left in sorrow,
That's what happens when you mess with mom tomorrow."

Okay, picture this - I saw this girl Chloris and let me just say, she was fire.
Neleus was hooked on her, he gave her presents that he had to acquire.
Her dad Amphion was the king of Orchomenus,
Her beauty was legendary, everyone knew this.
Nestor, Chromius and Periclymenus were her sons, but even better,
Pero, her daughter, had all the men in a thirst trap, you couldn't forget her.
Neleus wouldn't let just anyone have her, oh no,
Only someone who could steal from Iphicles, his cattle in tow.
After a year of being locked up, the seer completed his task,
He read the will of heaven, fulfilling it was no longer a huge ask.
Jove's plan came full circle, can you even imagine?
This story is epic, it's not outdated, it still has traction.

Bruh, let me tell you 'bout some Greek mythology,
There's Leda, Tyndarus' wife, with dope progeny,
Castor's a horse breaker, and Pollux likes to box,
Both lying in the earth, but they're not in a box.
See, Jove gave them this deal, to die and come alive,
Every other day, their legacy thrives,
They're considered gods, which is pretty lit,
And they'll keep coming back, just deal with it.

Yo, listen up, I've got a tale to tell,
Of Iphimedeia and her boys so swell,
She claimed she got with Neptune, oh wow,
And her sons Otus and Ephialtes, pow!

They were the most good looking and tall,
Nine years old but standing so tall,
Nine fathoms high, chest nine cubits wide,
Scaling mountains, with power and pride.

But their plans to fight the gods didn't go well,
Apollo took care of them and sent them to hell,
Before any hair grew on chin or cheek,
Their ambition, knocked out in just a single week.

Oh, and did I mention another guy,
Orion, who was famous, almost flew in the sky,
But these boys were better, or so they thought,
Until the tragic ending, that's what we've been taught. 

So let this be a lesson we learn,
Ambition can burn, but sometimes crash and burn.

Yo, let me tell you this story real quick,
About Theseus and fair Ariadne, who was slick.
Daughter of Minos, a magician so sly,
Theseus was in Crete, with no reason why.

He saw Phaedra, Procris, and then Ariadne,
And fell in love with her, as fate would decree.
He took her with him, on his way back home,
But they weren't alone, and soon would roam.

Diana killed her, on an island so small,
Bacchus had spoken, and she took the fall.
It's a medieval tale, but still pretty lit,
Too bad for Theseus, he couldn't handle it.

Oh dang, let me tell you who I saw
Maera, Clymene, and Eriphyle - she broke the law
She sold her husband for a piece of gold
That's crazy, that story never gets old

I could go on all night, talkin' 'bout the wives and daughters 
Of the heroes in the room, them goddesses with waters 
But it's time for me to hit the hay 
Whether on my crew's ship or where I stay 

As for my escort, I leave it up to the universe 
Heaven and y'all will make sure it won't be a curse 
Thanks for listening, y'all are the best 
Now excuse me as I go catch some rest

OMG, that story was fire, it had me feeling shook.
I can't believe I sat here listening like a book.
But we gotta give some props to our guest,
With his storytelling skills he deserves the best.

So let's all raise our glasses to this man,
And give him a round of applause if you can.
But before we end this lituation,
Let's have some more drinks and good conversation.

Yo, Phaecians, peeps!
This dude, like woah, he's tall and sleek!
Not to mention, he's got the smarts,
which sets him apart!

I know he's my guest, but don't be jealous,
join me in making his stay so zealous!
Don't be stingy with your blessings,
spread that wealth, no second-guessing!

This man's in need, can't you see?
So let's make it lit, for him and for we!
He's got the looks, the brains, the charm,
let's keep him here on this farm!

Oh snap, did you hear what Echeneus just said?
The man's so old, but he's still ahead! 
He spoke the truth that we all should hear, 
Queen's wise words are nothing to fear. 

Alcinous is the one with the ultimate decision, 
But let's not forget our queen's precision. 
Her words are gold, her advice is sound, 
Let's follow her lead and be championship-bound.

Yo, Alcinous, you the man,
Making plans that we all understand,
Our guest wants to go home quick,
But let's convince him to stay for a bit.

We'll give him money, that's no lie,
Just wait till tomorrow and you'll see why,
Our chief's gonna gather the cash,
So he can leave with a bigger stash.

Our guest can't leave without protection,
That's our duty, that's our connection,
It's up to all of us, not just one,
To make sure he reaches home, having fun.

So let's party tonight, enjoy the night,
And make sure our guest feels alright,
We'll keep him safe, we'll keep him sound,
Until he's back on his hometown ground.

Yo, King Alcinous, I'm feeling fab
If you want me to stay, that's not so bad
A year here with your gifts galore
I'll go home stronger than before.

Imagine the clout I'll have when I return
My people will love me, my status will burn
I'll be dripping in riches and respect
All because of the kindness you've checked.

I'll be the talk of the town, the king of the scene
Gaining followers with every meme
And my travels will not be in vain
For with these gifts, my people will gain.

So thank you, dear king, for your generosity
You've given me the keys to success and prosperity
And I'll make sure to give back as much as I get
With the hottest trends and the freshest net.

Yo, Alcinous, I gotta say
Your words just made my day
I'm no charlatan, no swindler
I'm a hero, a true winner

You ask if I saw the heroes of Troy
I did, and boy was it a joy
Achilles, Ajax, they were all there
Fighting with a courage so rare

I fought beside them, I was their mate
Our battles, they were truly great
None of us came out unscathed
But our spirits, they bravely stayed

I've told my story, I've bared my soul
I hope it's made you feel whole
But if you want more, I can go on
Like a meme that just keeps going strong

The evenings are long, the night is young
I'll keep talking till the rooster's sung
My adventures are divine, like a tasty treat
So kick back, Alcinous, and enjoy this sweet feat

Yo Alcinous, you want me to spit some tea?
I'll tell you the story, but first let me just say
Sometimes we talk too much, need to hit the hay
But since you insist, lemme give you the lowdown
On how my homies died, betrayed by a queen, so profound.

Itâ€™s a sadder tale than when your phone cracks
One woman led us astray, it was a quick attack
The Trojans didn't beat us, but she played us like a fiddle
With her lies and her schemes, we were caught in the middle. 

It was like when someone tweets fake news
And everyone believes it, even if it's a ruse
We trusted her, thought she was the real deal
But she was wicked, using us for her own appeal. 

Now my boys are gone, their fates were cruel
Thanks to her actions, they turned into fool's fuel
But I'm still here, telling this story with ease
Hoping you'll learn from our mistake, and avoid being deceived.

Yo, Proserpine sent the ladies far,
When Agamemnon's ghost approached to spar.
Sad and surrounded by those who died,
By his side, he cried and cried.

The blood, it gave him life once more,
And he ran to me, arms to explore.
But no might or matter did he possess,
I cried with him, such a mess.

"Agamemnon, how did you bite the dust,
Did Neptune unleash his rage on your bust?
Or did your foes catch you stealing some stock,
While they fought to defend their flock?"

Tell me, tell me, King of Mycenae,
What caused your ultimate demise, eh?

Yo, this is a story of hate
Of a man who met his fate
Ulysses, the noble son of Laertes
Was killed by his wife and Aegisthus while he ate
The wicked duo betrayed him with a feast
While his comrades died like pigs for the beast
On that day, blood was everywhere
The mixing-bowl, loaded tables, and bodies lied bare
Cassandra screamed, but fell to Clytemnestra's knife
As Ulysses lay on the ground, fighting for his life
He wanted revenge, but his wife slipped away
And left him to die in dismay
She wouldn't even close his eyes or his lips
On her guilt, all women's reputation dips
This heinous crime has brought disgrace
Even on the good women in this place

Hold up, hold up, let me get this straight,
You're saying Clytemnestra couldn't wait?
To stir up trouble while you're gone,
While you fight for Helen to come home?

Jove's been hatin' on the Atreus squad,
Especially when it comes to women's facades,
But oh man, look at all the bloodshed,
For the sake of the face that launched a thousand ships 

Clytemnestra's sneaky moves make us sad,
Betraying her man while he's out being rad,
But when it comes to drama, we know the Greeks,
Will always bring the heat, no matter the stakes.

Now, I gotta bounce and dip out quick,
Before this story gets too thick,
But seriously, keep us updated bro,
On all the drama in the ancient Greek show.

Yo Agamemnon, with all due respect,
Your advice for Ulysses is incorrect.
Telling his wife partial truths ain't cool,
Gotta keep it real and keep it true.

Penelope ain't one to cause strife,
She's an admirable woman with an excellent life.
Your own wife killed you, that's crazy,
Ulysses' wife is loyal, not shady.

Ithaca is where Ulysses heads to on his quest,
But Agamemnon, why not trust women, give them a rest?
Don't steal a march, be honest and true,
Not all women are the same, that's old news.

As for Orestes, I got no clue,
But I'll help Ulysses find him, that's what I'll do!

Agamemnon asked, 'Bruh, is my son okay?'
I replied, 'Sorry, man, can't say.'
Talking smack without the facts,
That's not cool in any chat.

Hey yo, as Ulysses sat in tears,
Achilles' ghost, and his peers,
Appeared before him in the dark,
With Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the leading mark.

Aeacus' descendant spoke out to him,
And Ulysses' chances looked quite dim,
"What death-defying feat have you to pursue,
Venturing down to Hades with us ghosts who are through?"

The fleet son of Laertes wasn't afraid,
These fallen heroes had his respect paid,
For he was a warrior like them,
And he'd go to the underworld, with no hate or venom.

He replied, "I'm here to learn,
And their great respect, for me, they did earn.
I've heard the stories of the dead,
And I'm curious to see what lies ahead."

I was chillin' with Peleus' son,
Achilles, a hero who had won,
He asked me what I came to seek,
I said my home, my Ithaca, I've had it for a week.

It's been a struggle, a constant fight,
I'm plagued with trials day and night,
And you, Achilles, have lived the dream,
A legend in life, a king supreme.

Don't be sad, don't fret or frown,
No one can bring your greatness down,
Among the dead, you are still cool,
A prince to all, a god-like jewel.

So don't worry, man, just take a rest,
You are the best, you passed life's test,
And for me, I'll keep pushing through,
Like a boss, like a savage, like a Twitter guru.

Yo, don't say a peep, 
I'd rather be alive and sweep, 
A paid servant of a poor man's keep,
Than be dead as heck, buried deep.

But tell me 'bout my son, 
Will he be a soldier, has he begun? 
Will he be great and overcome, 
Or is everything just for fun?

Also, my father Peleus, 
Is he still respected, is he famous? 
In Phthia and Hellas, where my fame is, 
Are they giving him props, or just shameless?

If I could stand by his side,
In all my glory, arms open wide,
I'd be his protector, with all my might,
And no one could challenge his righteous might.

Oh, oh, oh, let me tell you a tale,
 'bout Neoptolemus, that son, Neoptolemus, who never did fail.
This dude was a warrior with the finest judgement,
He always spoke first, dishing out the winning sentiments.
In combat, he never stayed back, no, not he,
He was the bravest warrior, the greatest you'll ever see.
He killed the hero Eurypylus like it was a breeze,
With the help of bribes from a woman, he brought the man to his knees.
When the Argives went inside that treacherous horse,
This guy was all bold, he never had to be forced.
While others were panicking, he stayed so calm,
Wielding his sword and spear, he remained like a bomb.
He urged them to break out and destroy the enemy,
This guy was determined and fierce, a real virtuosity.
Yet after the battle, he got his fair share,
And all without a single wound, none could compare.
So that's my story, it's all about chance,
That weird fortune of war that puts us in a trance.

Oh dang, can you believe 
That ghostly man, Achilles 
Just walked right in, all bold and proud 
Strutting like he's king of the crowd 

But I had to spill some tea 
'Bout his son's strength, so wild and free 
And that ghost just went off, honey 
Running through a meadow, oh so sunny 

The flowers there were asphodel 
And Achilles was feeling swell 
Cause his son's got some serious skill 
Gonna be the best, just you wait, I feel 

So don't mess with that ghostly crew 
They're coming in hot, it's oh so true 
And with Achilles on your side 
You'll be the champ, no need to hide

Yo, the spirits of the dead bros all up on me,
Gave me stories sad as can be,
But Ajax's ghost, he kept his distance,
Stuck in a grudge, that's his persistence.

Thetis offered up Achilles' armor,
Trojan prisoners and Minerva judged with candor,
But when I won, Ajax got tight,
And it cost him his life, no more fighting in sight.

It's a bummer, man, I regret that day,
The loss of such a mighty warrior in this way.

Yo, when I saw him I felt kinda grim,
Ajax, still simmering about the hateful trim.
Despite his death, he couldn't forgive or forget
That ol' armour judgment still gave him upset.

Bro, losing you hit the Argives super hard,
Your strength was legendary, they're still scarred.
We mourned you like Achilles, the warrior bold,
But Zeus' grudge against us left hearts cold.

Ajax, homie, come and hear me right,
Don't let that pride keep you up at night.
I got some intel, some tea to spill,
So listen up, don't be standing still.

Yo, this guy ain't giving me a reply
He's turned away and left me high and dry
If he thinks he can ghost me, he's wrong
I won't give up, it's gonna take so long

I could've made him talk, even if he's pissed
I would've known what he's hidden and missed
But other dead homies await my arrival
Their stories and secrets, I can't deny them

So I'll keep walking, through Erebus I'll go
And search for the answers, that I'm dying to know
I'm not giving up, I'm on a mission
To hear all the tales, from beyond the apparition.

OMG this scene is wild, 
The ghosts all around, seeking a trial 
Minos son of Jove, with his sceptre so gold 
Making judgements in a house so cold 

Sitting and standing, the spirits await 
Eagerly listening to their final fate 
Will they go to the fields of the Elysian 
Or fall into Tartarus, it's quite imprisonin' 

It's like "American Idol" but for the dead 
Judging souls, giving them what's ahead 
It's all happening in the underworld 
Where the dead reside, it's like another world 

I can't believe what I'm hearing and seeing 
The sentences given, it's all so freeing 
From their mortal coils they've broken free 
Now they await their fate, for all to see

Oh snap, hold up, let me tell ya 'bout Orion
He's in a meadow with beasts he was firin'
Driving their ghosts like a boss man
Lookin' fly with his bronze club in hand!

It's unbreakable, can you believe it?
This club's got strength, he can't even cheat it
Orion's slayin' these beasts like it's nothin'
Just another day, frontin' and stuntin'

This meadow's full of asphodel, a sight to see
Beasts fallin' left and right, he's makin' them flee
Orion's a legend, a dude in his prime
Killin' beasts and takin' names, every time

So if you ever need someone to get rid of the wild
Call up Orion, he's got style and he's wild
He's chillin' in the meadow, go say what's up
But don't get too close, or he might f*ck you up!

Whoa, hold up, let me translate for you,
Homer's got Tityus, stretched out on the floor, boo-hoo,
Two vultures were pecking at his liver,
All 'cause he messed with Jove's mistress, a real giver,
She was just passing through, on her way to Pytho,
But Tityus couldn't resist and now he's a big no-no. 
It's like when you slide into someone's DMs,
But they don't want ya, it's a real gem,
Cuz you messed with what's not yours to mess with,
And now the vultures are here to put you in a ditch.

That Tantalus was stuck in a bad place,
Water at his chin but couldn't drink a trace.
Every time he leaned down to take a sip,
The water disappeared like a Snapchat flip.

The dude was parched and dying for a drink,
But the heavens had a mean, terrible link.
There were trees that showered fruits galore,
All he had to do was reach out for more.

But whenever he tried to grab a tasty treat,
The wind would blow and knock him off his feet.
He couldn't catch a break, he was living in pain,
Just like I do whenever I miss the hype train.

Yo, let me tell you 'bout Sisyphus,
Pushing up that huge rock is just ridiculous.
He tries so hard, puts his all in,
But that stone drops down and starts again.

Sweat drippin', steam risin' high,
This task will never let him say bye.
He pushes with his feet and both his hands,
But the stone rolls down, no chance to take a stand.

Poor Sisyphus, his task's never done,
Being punished by the God's so he can't have fun.
But that's just not fair, we gotta change the game,
And shout a little louder, give him some fame. 

Like when Drake said, "Started from the bottom, now we here",
Our boy Sisyphus deserves some cheers.
Let's raise him up, give him a win,
And show that rock, it doesn't always win.

Yo, let me tell you 'bout a vision so surreal,
I saw mighty Hercules, but his body wasn't real.
He's feasting with the gods and his lady Hebe
While ghosts scream and swarm like a wild, scared bevy.

Herc's bow was bare, his arrow was drawn,
He was ready to shoot, like a cyberspace con.
A golden belt was wrapped around his chest,
Adorned with beasts, fierce and the best.

Bears, wild boars, and lions with eyes so bright,
Plus war, battle, and death, an epic sight.
Making this belt again is impossible, you see,
For a mere mortal, it's as hard as can be.

As soon as he saw me, he called out my name,
"Poor Ulysses, are you also living a life of shame?"
As he once was enslaved by someone really bad,
He wished me all the best and didn't want me to be sad.

He sent me to Hades to fetch a hell-hound to train,
Mercury and Minerva helped me, it wasn't in vain.
So now you listen and hear what I've seen,
A myth so surreal, it's like it's never been. 

#NoHashtags #LitAF

Yo listen up, let me tell you a tale
Of Hercules' journey that he did prevail
Down to the house of Hades he did go
And faced such horrors, don't you know?

I stayed behind, just in case
Other mighty dead showed their face
Theseus and Pirithous, children of gods
I wanted to see them, it's no fraud

But the ghosts came, with their eerie cries
I feared Proserpine, and her deadly ties
The Gorgon's head, could she unleash?
My heart raced, my mind at peace

We rushed back to the ship, our hearts full of dread
Loose the hawsers, let's leave this place, I said
Rowing at first, but soon we were blessed
A fair wind that blew, and put us to the test.

Hey hey, it's your favorite assistant in the place,
Ready to tell you stories with that Gen-Z taste.
I got the tea, the drama, and all the latest memes,
So buckle up and listen, 'cause this is where it beams.

First up we have a crazy tale 'bout Kylie Jenner,
Who got her makeup line poppin' like a killer.
But then she gave it up to sis, Kim K,
Who made the deal even bigger, no cap, no disarray.

Next is our boy Jeff Bezos, the Amazon king,
Who's so rich he could buy you a diamond ring.
But his love life got messy, with a scandal to boot,
When he left his wife for a new bae, it was quite the hoot.

And who could forget, the queen of pop herself, BeyoncÃ©,
Who slays every move, every beat, every single day.
She dropped Lemonade, and we all felt the power,
So we'll bow down, 'cause she's the one who's got the flour.

Last but not least, we got our fave candy,
TikToks about it we've all seen, so dandy.
I'm talking 'bout the Sour Patch Kids,
That make our taste buds do some wicked flips.

So there you have it, some lit stories from me,
All rhymed up and filled with Gen-Z glee.
Till next time, keep it cool and stay in the zone,
And remember, like, share, and subscribe, 'cause this is your home.

BOOK XII

Yo, let me tell you 'bout a voyage so lit
The crew was dope, and the captain was fit
We cruised through Oceanus, no need to get vexed
And hit the Aeaean island where the sun first wrecks

We landed on the shore, feeling so fly
And fell asleep as the sun climbed up high
We waited for dawn with bated breath, 
Cause on this island, sunrise was the best

Our ship was chill, so we drew it on the sand 
And rocked those islands like a boss from our land 
Now listen, cause our journey ain't done yet 
And we had more fire to spit, you can bet

Oh wow, Odysseus, you slayin',  
Sending men to fetch your fallen Elpenor to keep him playin',  
With firewood gathered from the jutted out wood near the sea,  
You wept and lamented him with the ritual to set him free.  

His body, burned to ashes, a cairn was the site for,  
And at the top, an oar; oh how it told his story more,  
A symbol of his skill to row the boat,  
Now a memory that will never be remote.  

Your journey, Odysseus, has been wild,  
From battles to gods, your tale, oh so dialed,  
Forever a legend, an epic in every way,  
Your courage and wit, forever on display.
