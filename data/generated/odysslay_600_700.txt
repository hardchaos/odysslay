Eumaeus, my man, you're so hospitable
I'm feeling grateful, don't be doubtful
It's supper time, I'm feeling fine
Let's cook something savory, divinely divine

But hold up, my dude, let's talk about trust
If I killed you, it'd be pretty unjust
I won't do that, I'll keep it real
My morals are strong, I never steal

Let's be lit, let's eat and chat
About life, love and stuff like that
I'm grateful for this shelter you've shared
You're the real MVP, don't be scared

Yo Eumaeus, hear me out,
Let's sacrifice that pig, no doubt,
But make sure it's the best in the land,
So we can party and take a stand.

Toll of him ourselves we will,
Cause we've worked hard and it's time to chill,
These pigs have caused us so much strife,
Let's make a sacrifice and enjoy life.

Bring on the squealing and grunting sounds,
As we lock them up in their sties and grounds,
But let's not forget the chosen one,
The pig we'll sacrifice to have some fun.

We'll feast and hang out like the cool kids do,
Celebrating with drinks and BBQ,
With memes and slang we'll make it lit,
Cause that's how we celebrate, every bit.

So let's go ahead and get things started,
The best pig in the land, selected and becarded,
We'll make this a night to remember,
With swineherds and pigs, a party we'll render.

Yo listen up, let me tell you a tale,
About Eumaeus, a man that would never fail.
He was chopping wood when a pig arrived,
And they knew with a feast they'd soon be revived.

Before cooking, Eumaeus paid his respects,
Cutting bristles off the pig, it's what he expects.
He prayed to all the gods for Ulysses' return,
His morals and principles, something we should learn.

After striking the pig with a billet of oak,
They singed it and cut it, which wasn't a joke.
Eumaeus put some fat and barley on the coals,
Roasting the meat till it was good for our goals.

When it was ready, he made seven portions,
One for Mercury and the nymphs, no distortions.
The others he gave to each man, one by one,
Honouring Ulysses, his kindness never undone.

Ulysses was grateful for the meat he received,
Eumaeus' kindness, something he believed.
He hoped that Jove would also be kind,
To Eumaeus, a man of true peace of mind. 

#lit #respect #hype #feast #gods #grateful #outcast #kindness #morals #principles

Yo, my homie Eumaeus, 
Chow down and get full with us
God hands out blessings and takes away,
‘Cause he’s the boss, it's clear as day.

But enough of that preachy spiel,
Take another bite of your meal,
Enjoy it like its finest feast,
And let your taste buds have a feast.

Life is short, we gotta take what we get,
So embrace the good moments, don’t fret.
God's got a plan, it may be mystifying,
But trust in the process, it's satisfying.

So let's eat, drink, and be merry,
For tomorrow there may be no sherry.
God's got our back, we’ll be just fine,
As long as we enjoy this fleeting time.

The swineherd offered food to the gods in the sky,
And then passed the cup to Ulysses, oh my!
He chowed down on the food, all fluffy and nice,
And then went to bed, with his friends by his side.

This guy Mesaulius, what a true homie,
Bought bread for them all, not even a crony,
Without telling the mistress or his dad,
That's trust and loyalty that would make anyone glad.

They ate and they drank 'till their bellies were full,
And then hit the hay, no more food to pull.
Night had fallen, the moon shone bright,
Time to catch some Zs, and rest for the night.

Aye, it's stormin' and it's dark  
But Ulysses is still on a lark  
He wanted to see if he'd get lucky  
And Eumaeus would give him a cloak that's fluffy  

"Yo, listen up," he said with glee  
"I've got somethin' to tell, you'll see  
It's the wine talkin', so don't ya fret  
It makes me sing, dance, and chirp like a pet"  

Back in the day, Ulysses did lead  
In Troy, they planted an ambush seed  
Beneath the brush, they did reside  
Took cover from the cold and the snow that did slide  

The others had cloaks and shirts to wear  
And slept with their shields, without a care  
But Ulysses, oh he had forgot  
Left without his cloak, sittin' in a cold spot  

Two-thirds of the night had gone past  
Stars movin', the cold wind's blast  
Ulysses nudged with an elbow touch  
And whispered in his ear, it wasn't much

'Oh no, that's such a bummer dude, your frosty situation is really rude. Zeus played you like a fool and left you in the frigid pool. Fear not, bro, for I have a plan, we'll make some clothes with our own hands. We'll find some leaves and cover you up, like nature's own designer clothes, yup!' #SurvivalSkills #MythologyMemes #WinterWoes

"Aye aye, that's what I'm talking about, Ulysses was no mere peasant, he's the OG of mythological legend! With his brain that was as sharp as a sword, he came up with a plan that really soared. He was like Drake, started from the bottom, now he's here - outsmarting the gods without a single tear. Ulysses knew what's up, he wasn't a fool, his plan was so sly, it's like he went to Slytherin school. He was the king of the Trojan Horse, his cunningness could cause a divorce. This plan was his bread and butter, kinda like that meme with bread cat that everyone loves to utter."

"Stop moving, bro," he whispered down low. "Or you'll give us away, you know?" He propped himself up on one elbow. 

("Bro" can be used in place of "yo" sometimes!)

Yo, my dudes, listen to me
Last night I had a dream quite trippy
We're far from the ships, can't you see?
We need more men, like, pretty quickly

I wish someone could go down
And tell Agamemnon to send 'em on up
Or else we'll be left to drown
And end up empty as a Starbucks cup

We gotta get our squad in check
And fight like we're in a battle royale
With our swords and spears to protect
And win this war like we're epic and hella frail

So let's roll out like Optimus Prime
And show those Trojans what we're made of
And when we're done, we'll raise the roof, it's time
To celebrate and eat some Chick-fil-A, much love!

Oh snap, back in the day
Tholas ran like Usain Bolt, no delay
Left his cloak for the taking
I snatched it up, and my heart was breaking

Wish I could turn back time
When I was still in my prime
Nowadays, I'm treated like trash
'Cause my clothes got holes and rips and nasty rash

If only these swineherds knew
All the battles I've fought and been through
Maybe they'd show some respect
And give me a new outfit, direct

But no, they just judge and stare
Like they're better with their fancy wear
I'll keep on moving, though, no doubt
Even if I gotta go without.

Yo, old man, your story is sick,
It's been awesome hearing it,
You won't need clothes or anything more,
We'll give you what we can for sure.

But tomorrow, you'll have to wear,
Your old rags, it's only fair,
We don't have spare cloaks or shirts,
But we're not treating you like dirt.

When Ulysses' son returns from his trip,
He'll give you a new cloak and send you on your skip,
Wherever you need to go,
He'll hook you up, bro.

So don't worry, my man,
We've got you, we'll help you any way we can,
Just sit back and relax for the night,
We'll take care of you until we see some light.

Check it, Eumaeus ain't sleazy,
He hooked up Ulysses with a bed so cozy,
Threw down some skins on the ground,
And made sure he was warm and sound.

He covered him up with a heavy cloak,
In case the weather made him choke,
That's how you treat a guest, my dude,
Eumaeus knows what's good, it ain't rude.

Goatskins and sheepskins all around,
Making Ulysses feel like he's crowned,
And Eumaeus with the assist,
Giving Ulysses some sweet bliss.

It's all about hospitality,
Eumaeus got it, it's his reality,
Now Ulysses can rest with ease,
Thanks to Eumaeus, the goat with the keys.

Ulysses slept peaceful, getting some rest
With young men by his side, feeling blessed
But the swineherd wasn't one to snooze
Needed to check on pigs, that's his muse

He grabbed his sword and wore a thick cloak
Protecting himself from wind, it's no joke
Taking a goat's skin and javelin too
He's prepared for danger, that's his cue

Off he went to where the pigs lay
Under a rock, sheltered from the wind's sway
Making sure his property was all alright
Being a good steward, day and night.

Sup, sup, sup, let me tell you 'bout a story 
It's gonna make you LOL, it's gonna be so glory 
It's got memes up the wazoo, it's got all the feels 
You'll be ROFLing so hard, you won't need no meals 

There once was a dude, his name was Chad 
He was flexin' on the beach, he was looking mad 
But then came a wave, it knocked him down 
He was washed up on shore, he almost drowned 

But that's not the end, oh no, not even close 
'Cause then came a shark, and you know how that goes 
Chad was terrified, he thought he was done 
But then something crazy happened, it was like a pun 

A dolphin swam by, and it saved Chad's life 
He rode on its back, he was feeling so alive 
Now Chad's a changed man, he's got heart and soul 
He's telling everyone he knows, no more being a troll 

So next time you're feeling down, just remember this tale 
If a dolphin can save a Chad, then you can definitely prevail 
Stay lit, stay lit, don't let the haters get you down 
You're a boss, you're a king, wear that crown!

BOOK XV

Aye, Telemachus, it's time to bounce,
Your dad needs you, no time to lounge.
Minerva's the name, the goddess of war,
Here to tell you what you've been waiting for.

Your pops, Ulysses, needs your aid,
This journey of yours cannot be delayed.
Menelaus can help you on your quest,
But time is ticking, you gotta be the best.

Don't worry though, Minerva's got your back,
Like a boss, she's always on the attack.
You'll find your dad, it's gonna be dope,
But for now, let's bounce, no time to mope.

Yo Telemachus, it's time to bounce from this scene,
Don't let those suitors think they're king of the bean.
Your crib is gettin' eaten up and your mom's in distress,
Ask Menelaus to send you home, don't take no less.

Your lady's fam is tryna make her wed Eurymachus,
He thinks he's hot stuff, but he's really just frivolous.
Make sure nothing's taken from your crib, it ain't cool,
These chicks only think of themselves, they won't play you for a fool.

Head home and put your stuff in charge,
Of a lady who's legit, no need to be at large.
Be careful though, those suitors wanna take you down,
Sail night and day and your ship will hit no ground.

The god above will guide your way,
Those haters won't take you down, no way, no day.
Once you get home, holla at the swineherd,
He's got your back, no need for a watchword.

Stay for the night and then let Penelope know,
That you're not dead, you made it home, you're not feeling low.

Yo Pisistratus wake up from your nap,
Get the horses ready for a sweet sweet lap,
We gotta head home, it's time to depart,
And leave Olympus with a heavy heart.

Telemachus knows we gotta move soon,
Before the daylight fades into the moon,
Our journey continues and we mustn't stop,
Till we reach our home sweet home crop top.

So let's yoke those horses and get on the way,
Before the gods decide to make us stay,
Our story ends here but the adventure starts,
Setting off like lightning bolts, with our chariot and carts.

Dude, Pisistratus needs to chill,
Driving in the dark is bound to kill.
Gotta wait for Menelaus to come through,
And show some love, that's what we gotta do.

Being a guest is not just a vibe,
It's a bond you have to rightly describe.
Hospitality is key, it's not a game,
Menelaus deserves recognition, it's not lame.

Presents in the chariot, that's pretty neat,
Just like that meme of the cat who can't be beat.
And saying goodbye, it's a must,
It's the proper thing to do, no need to fuss.

Oh snap, Menelaus is in the mix,
Telemachus puts on his fit,
Throwing a cloak over his back,
He heads out to meet him, no time to slack.

"Menelaus, my man," Telemachus said,
"I need to head home, no time for bed."
I've been searching for my dad,
And though your hospitality has been rad,
It's time for me to hit the road again,
Before the journey drives me insane, you savvy friend?

Menelaus nodded, understanding with ease,
"I'll give you gifts, to appease,"
For though he didn't want to see him go,
He knew in his heart, it was time to let him flow.

From the ground, Menelaus took his leave,
Bestowing gifts that Telemachus would keep,
A silver mixing bowl, and a two-handled cup,
Worth more than a few bucks, level up!

"Safe travels, young buck, take care,"
Menelaus said, with a handshake to bear,
With that, Telemachus was on his way,
Back to Ithaca, hoping for a brighter day.

Aye Telemachus, if you truly wanna go,
I'll not hold you back, that much I know.
A grateful host shouldn't be too clingy,
Or too quick to say goodbye, that's just dingy.
We gotta be moderate, that's the key,
Letting guests stay or go, that's the way to be.
But before you leave, let me show,
The beautiful presents, I want you to know.
Let the women prepare a dinner just right,
Before you go out and take flight.
And if you have a whim to explore and roam,
I'll drive you myself, with my horses and chrome.
No one will let us leave with empty hands,
Bronze tripods, mules or even gold cups is what stands.

Yo Telemachus, I feel you, I ain't gonna front,
You gotta protect your property, that's what you want,
But listen, fam, you gotta chill and take a breath,
You can't just bounce right now, you might find your dad's address.

I know it's scary, thinkin' bout your valuables alone,
But you gotta trust the world, you gotta roam,
Your pops is out there, you gotta find him soon,
Just focus on that, and you'll return to your property like a harpoon.

Don't worry 'bout the rumors, don't worry 'bout the theft,
We got your back, we'll protect your bereft,
So let's go on this journey, find your father with pride,
And when we return, your property will be waiting with bated tide.

Yo Menelaus, he was chillin' at home
When he heard a story that made him all alone
He called his wife, said "Girl, dinner's on
Go cook some meat, let's make it a feast, let's get it done"

Then Eteoneus dropped by and helped with the fire
They cooked some meat, they got it all wired
While Menelaus and Helen, they went downstairs
To get some stuff, some treasures to share

Menelaus grabbed a cup, oh so fine
And told his son to bring a mixing-bowl in no time
Helen picked a dress straight from her chest
It shone like a star, it had to be the best

They walked back to Telemachus, all smiles
Menelaus wished him safe travels with style
He gifted him with his most precious belonging
A silver mixing-bowl that had everyone longing

Phaedimus was the king who gave it to Menelaus
On his way back from a journey, that was a plus
Now Telemachus got it, and it was all good
A present from Menelaus, an act of brotherhood.

Yo, what's up my lit squad,
Let me tell you 'bout a dope Greek god.
Telemachus was his name,
And his drink game was never lame.

His hands held a double cup,
And you know for sure it's lit, yup.
Megapenthes brought a fresh bowl,
Looking hot, straight outta control.

But hold up, miss Helen on the scene,
Got a robe ready, you know she's queen.
A beauty that can steal the show,
Looking fresh, head to toe.

So listen up, 'cause this tale's amazing,
Telemachus and crew, they're truly blazing.
Greek gods may be old school,
But their party game was incredibly cool.

"Yo yo, my dude," she said with glee,
"I got something here, just for thee.
A gift from Helen, oh so rare,
For your bride to wear, if you dare.
Keep it safe, don't let it stray,
Till the big wedding day.

Oh man, this trinket is legit,
Perfect for your bride to outfit.
Just give it to your mom to keep,
On your way home, you can sleep.
Back to your land, full of glee,
This gift from Helen will guarantee."

Yo, let me tell you 'bout a tale, it's straight from ancient Greece,
It involves Menelaus, Telemachus, and some feasts.

Pisistratus and Telemachus pulled up in a chariot,
Menelaus welcomed them and gave them gifts, no bullsh*t.
A golden ewer and silver basin for their hands,
The feast was lavish, they had everything grand.

The servants brought them bread and carved the meat,
Megapenthes poured the wine, it was so sweet.
They ate and drank till they could have no more,
Then Telemachus and Pisistratus headed for the door.

Menelaus came after them, with a golden goblet in sight,
He gave a drink-offering, wished them a safe flight.
"Farewell, my dudes! Tell Nestor how I treated you right,
Like a caring father, shining oh so bright!"

Oh dang, Telema-slayin' with the gifts today,
Gonna make Ulysses' heart say "yay".
We'll spill the tea to him, don't you fret,
All the kindness we've met from the folks we've met.

When we get back to Ithaca town,
We'll tell him of the gifts he's gonna crown.
This journey's been lit, with your generosity,
We'll share your deeds with the utmost sincerity.

Oh snap, y'all! Did you see that bird?
An eagle with a white goose, it's so absurd!
Everyone's running, shouting, and going berserk,
But hold up, wait a minute, let me get to the work.

Pisistratus, my dude, he asks the real question,
Was this omen for us or for you? It's like an intervention!
Menelaus, you gotta tell us what it means,
Is it good or bad, or is it something in between?

I'm not one to speculate, but I have a hunch,
This omen might mean something, it's not just a punch.
Up high in the sky, the bird flew so fast,
It's like the internet, it moves quick, it lasts.

So, let's take this as a sign and have some hope,
Maybe everything will be alright and we'll be able to cope.
For now, let's enjoy this moment and let our hearts take comfort,
As we move forward, we won't let this omen distort.

Oh snap, did you hear what Helen said?
She spilled tea and left everyone shook in bed.
She talked about Ulysses and his revenge plan,
And how he might already be back, quite the man.

She compared him to an eagle from its nest,
And said he's been through trials, and oh the quest.
She's reading this matter from her heart,
And trust me, she's one smart work of art.

Ulysses better watch out for the suitors,
They're in for a surprise, a little computer rebooter.
Helen's prediction will come to pass,
And when it does, it'll be a grand slam, no sass. 

So Menelaus, don't think too much,
Trust in Helen and keep in touch.
We don't want you to miss the fun,
When Ulysses delivers his revenge run.

Oh dang, Telemachus with the plans
Vowing to Athena like she's in high demand
Saying "May Jove so grant it" like he's in the know
Pledging to make vows to her like she's his main bro

Telemachus knows what's up like a boss
Talking to Athena like they're hangin' at the Cross
If it's really her, he'll give her thanks like a hero
And make promises to her like she's #1 at ground zero.

"Yo, these horses are so beast,
not to mention the speed, in the streets.
We cruised through the town like kings,
with everyone staring and doing wild things.

Pherae was our next stop for the night,
Diocles treated us right, no fright.
When rosy-fingered Dawn came to play,
we got back in the chariot and made our way.

Through the gateway we passed with ease,
our horses felt the breeze, no need to please.
Pisistratus was in control, no time to stall,
to Pylos we went, Telemachus said it all."

Oh dude, Pisistratus, you gotta make a vow, 
Our dads were friends, you know that right now, 
We're the same age, this journey brings us near, 
Don't take me past my ship, my man, my dear. 

I can't go to your dad's house, tryna chill, 
He'll make me stay, I need to leave, for real. 
I gotta head home, don't wanna be late, 
Promise me, Pisistratus, it's not up for debate. 

Don't get me wrong, your dad is really cool, 
But I've got things to do, I'm not some fool. 
I need to catch my ship, it's time to go, 
Make me this promise, it's gotta be a bro-to-bro. 

I hope you'll get me, and understand, 
I'm not trying to diss your father, I'm just trying to plan. 
So, make the promise, and let's be on our way, 
Thanks, dude, you're a real homie, okay?

Aye, Pisistratus, you got the plan,
Gotta put them gifts in that stern, can you understand?
Hop on board, tell your crew too,
Before your papa comes, all mad and blue.

I know the old man and his toughness,
He'll come for sure, but you gotta be ruthless.
He won't go back if you're not there,
So go, go, go, without a care.

But bro, he'll be angrier than Kanye,
When he comes and sees you sailin' away.
Just focus on the task at hand,
And leave the rest to fate's sweet strand.

Oh snap, Telemachus is in charge
He's leading the men, they're living large
They gotta get on the ship and leave this land
And head back home, they've got a plan

The Pylians were cool, but it's time to go
Telemachus said it, so it's a go
They gotta get everything in order, make it neat
And set sail home, it'll be a treat

But hold up, there's more, he's not done yet
Telemachus has orders, don't forget
He's gotta lead the way, gotta be the boss
And get his crew home, without a loss

So let's get it, team, and don't be slow
It's time to go and let the wind blow
We'll make it back home, just you wait and see
Thanks to Telemachus, he's the MVP

Telemachus, on his ship he prayed,
And to Minerva he did say,
But then a seer came his way,
A man who'd killed with no delay.

Melampus' descendant he,
From Pylos he came to flee,
A powerful king was his enemy,
Neleus, who'd caused him misery.

He held him captive for a year,
In his great house, a prisoner in fear,
But Melampus in the end was clear,
And left him, his revenge was near.

To Argos he went and ruled,
His riches and lands, he sure fooled,
Got two sons, both really cool,
Antiphates and Mantius, jewels.

Antiphates had a son,
Oicleus, who had tons of fun,
But alas, he was slain and done,
For a woman's gifts, he could not shun.

His sons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus,
One dead, the other a seer who was righteous,
Mantius was father to Cleitus,
Whom Aurora loved for being so gorgeous.

But Apollo made Polypheides a seer,
Greater than his father, oh dear,
He left and prophesied far and near,
For all to hear, oh so clear.

Yo, Theoclymenus, my man,
I can tell you Telemachus' plan,
But first I gotta know where you from,
And who you really are, where you're from.

We both know you're not here for the view,
So spill the tea, what's the real breakthrough?
Telemachus is a legend of his time,
A true hero with power so divine.

He's making sacrifices, showing respect,
To get the gods' blessings, we all expect.
But you seem curious, asking for info,
Don't worry, don't fret, I'm about to show.

Telemachus is from Ithaca, it's true,
His dad is the legend, the one and only Odysseus, too.
But that's just the start, there's more to tell,
Stories so epic, you'll be under his spell.

So sit back, relax, and let me enlighten,
The journey of Telemachus, it's frightenin'.
But with allies like us, he'll be just fine,
And emerge victorious, every single time.

Oh, snap, Telemachus, you're quite the boss,
Your rhymes are dope, your crew is first class.
Ithaca, you said? Ulysses is your dad? 
No lie, that's sick, you must be so glad.

But hold up, hold up, something seems wrong,
You said he's missing, and it's been so long.
What happened to him? Tell us the truth,
We'll help you find him, we'll be your crew.

You've got the ship, you've got the team,
Together we'll search, it'll be a dream.
We'll comb every sea, we'll check every shore,
Until we find him, and bring him ashore.

Keep your head up, Telemachus, we've got your back,
We'll use every meme, we'll stay on track.
We'll slide into DMs, we'll post on our story,
Until we bring Ulysses back to glory.

Yo, Theoclymenus, my dude in need,
Your story is lit, I must concede.
You killed a man, your own blood,
And now you roam as a wandering stud.

Argos is where your foes reside,
And their power, they don't try to hide.
You fear their wrath and seek to flee,
To escape their clutches and live free.

You beseech us to take you in,
To sail with us and avoid a sin.
We hear your plea and offer aid,
A safe journey, we have conveyed.

Board our ship, Theoclymenus, my man,
Our kindness is part of a bigger plan.
To help all those in need of a hand,
For in this world, that's how we all stand.

Onward we sail with you by our side,
As we navigate the waters far and wide.
Together we stand, and together we'll glide,
With our ship as our trusty guide.

Aye aye, Telemachus, you got it right,
We welcome all travelers, day or night.
No cap, come chill with us in Ithaca town,
We'll treat you hospitably and show you around.
We'll catch some waves like the VSCO girls do,
And sip on our matcha, what about you?
Don't even trip, our hospitality is lit,
So come on over and let's vibe a bit.

Yo, Telemachus is on a quest!
On the ship, they hoisted their sails and lifts,
Thanks to Athena's breezy bequest.
They cruised by Crouni and Chalcis, gifting them swift shifts.
Theoclymenus' spear was at rest,
As he sat on the stern with our boy, no rift.
This journey is gonna be the best,
Athena's guidance as the ship adrift.
#ShipShipHooray, They are off to a great start,
I pray their journey will never depart.

The sun went down and it got really dark, 
Telemachus sailed on, making a quick embark. 
He went past Pheae, then to Elis, where Epeans reign,
But he couldn't shake off the fear of getting caught in pain.

He sailed towards the flying islands, 
Thinking to himself, "Should I be silent?" 
Should he fight for his life, or surrender without a deal? 
He wondered and pondered about what would be his fate, for real. 

But hey, we believe in Telemachus, he's got this, 
He's as lit as they come, he'll rid of his fuss. 
He might be in a pickle, but he won't back down,
Telemachus is a total king, he's bound to wear that crown.

Yo, swineherd, my guy,
I gotta know before I say bye-bye,
Will you be cool and let me stay,
Or toss me out without delay?

I know I'm just a stranger,
But I ain't no danger,
I'm just a dude who's lost his way,
And needs a place to stay.

Plus, I'm pretty good at riddles,
A skill that'll come in handy like Skittles.
So if you let me stick around,
I'll prove my worth and never let you down.

But if you want me out of sight,
I'll leave without a fight,
Just tell me what you want me to do,
And I'll follow through. 

Which answer will it be,
My swineherd homie? Let's see!

Yo Eumaeus, and crew,
I gotta bounce, it's true.
To beg around town,
So I'm no longer a burden, weighin' you down.
Can y'all give advice, 
And find a guide, precise? 
I'll beg for bread and drink,
'Hoping someone gives me time to think.
I wanna go to Penelope,
And give her some news quite dope-y.
Maybe I'll hit up the suitors,
And see if they'll let me be their waiter.
Believe me, I'm a handy dude,
I'll chop wood and cook some food.
Mercury will bless my labor,
And give me that good name and favor.

Oh dang, the swineherd is shook,
He don't wanna see you become a cook.
The suitors are boujee and obnoxious,
Their pride is sky-high, kinda monstrous.

They wouldn't think twice about a guy like you,
Their servants are young, well-dressed, it's true.
They got the bread, the meat, and the wine,
Their tables are clean, and everything's just fine.

So don't even think about joining their crew,
You don't fit the bill, it's not for you.
Stay here, man, you're not in the way,
The others don't mind, they're cool to stay.

Telemachus will hook you up with a fit,
A shirt, a cloak, you won't be a misfit.
And he'll also send you wherever you please,
Just chill out here, man, no need to please.

Oh dear Ulysses, you're quite the guy,
Avoiding trouble as you pass on by,
Your journey has been a rocky ride,
But at least you're grateful to the one by your side.

Now you wanna know about your kin,
Your mom and pop, are they still livin'?
Or have they crossed the river Styx,
Leaving you with a heart that's deeply mixed?

Well, let me tell you what I know,
From the top, and not too slow,
Your dad is sitting pretty at home,
Old but alive, and not ready to roam.

Your mom, on the other hand, is a mystery,
Some say dead, some claim victory,
But no one knows for sure where she lies,
Perhaps she's in the afterlife, soaking up the skies.

So, my friend, sit tight and enjoy the view,
Telemachus will return, and bring with him some news,
Until then, I'll stay and talk with you,
Passing the time with YouTube reviews.

Yo, lemme spill the tea,
Eumaeus' story, come and hear it from me.
Laertes, his master, is still alive,
But he's struggling, and it's hard for him to thrive.

His wife died, grief consumed her heart,
And his son's absence, also tore him apart.
Eumaeus was raised with their youngest daughter,
Ctimene, who was sent away with a dowry that brought laughter.

Now the mistress does not show him love,
The house is run by wicked people, heavens above!
But Eumaeus still does his work with pride,
And shows strangers kindness with what he can provide.

Sometimes, the servants just want to chat,
And have a bite to eat, where they're at,
But with the mistress being so cruel,
Kindness is something all crave and drool. 

In this world, it's tough to find goodness,
But Eumaeus is the one who serves with happiness.

Eumaeus, oh Eumaeus, you bring me such joy
With your story so wild, I'll treat it like a toy
Tell me the truth, don't try to deceive
Did some enemies nab you before you could leave?

Did they wreak havoc on your family and town
Leaving nothing but rubble on the ground
Or were you left alone, just tending to sheep
When they snatched you up to sell like a cheap creep

I'm just trying to get the facts, you see
So that we can be friends, and you can trust me
I know being a slave isn't easy or fun
But I'll do what I can to make it more fun

Now let's cut to the chase, let's skip all the doubt
And tell me, do you know what this meme is about?
It's a cat with a face that's oh so grumpy
And everyone knows it, it's called "Grumpy Cat" comfy.

Aye aye, Eumaeus, your words are tight,
I'll sit back, sip my wine all night,
Longest nights allow for convos sweet,
Talking through the hours, no need to retreat.

Too much sleep? Yeah, that's a fact,
But too little's just as bad, that's the hack,
If someone else wants to hit the hay,
Let them do so, no need to stay.

We'll keep chowing down, telling tales,
Sharing our misfortunes and our fails,
For when one's suffered in this life,
Recalling sorrows cuts through the strife.

And now to your question, I'll be real,
My story's coming, it's no big ordeal.
Let's eat, drink, and bond some more,
And then my tale, I'll gladly pour.

Aye, let me tell you 'bout Syra, an island that's tight,
Over Ortygia, where the land takes a sight,
Not many people live there, but the soil is great,
With cattle-grazing pasture and wine that's first-rate.
 
No famine or diseases will you find on this land,
And when old folks die, Apollo's painless with his magic wand.
Two communities thrive there, each with its own sway,
And my dad, Ctesius, reigned like a god in his day.
 
He was one in a million, my father was fly,
Feared by many, respected by all, that's no lie.
His name was known to all, his word was law,
And he brought much prosperity to his land with no flaw.

Okay, so here's the deal, 
listen up and get on heel.
Some Phoenician traders came 
with a ship full of items that were lit in fame.
They saw a tall and comely maid, 
and with their charms, they began to raid.
They seduced her with words so sly, 
and got her to spill the beans, oh my.
She told them of her father's fame,
and how she was sold and became,
a servant in her master's house, 
after some pirates came like a louse.
But wait, there's more to the tale, 
these Phoenicians were up for sale.
Stay tuned to hear what's next 
this story will leave you vexed.

Okay, okay, so listen to this scoop,
This girl got seduced, but wait, there's the hoop,
The man said, "Come see your parents, they're doing just swell,"
And the girl was like, "What the hell?"

But wait a minute, there's more to this tale,
The man was smooth, but she couldn't fail,
To see through his game, his act, his schtick,
And she thought, "This man is just too slick."

So she told him, "Nah, I'll have to pass,
My real parents aren't like you, they've got way more class,"
And the man was stunned, he couldn't believe,
That this girl wasn't so easily deceived.

But you know what they say, truth always wins,
And this girl knew all her parents' kins,
So the man left, and she stayed true,
And we know she made the right move, too. 

#dramaalert #savage #notfallingforit

Oh, girl is smart, ain't no one gonna harm her on their path.
She made them swear, ain't no breaking her trust, that's a fact.
She's got the power, got them in checkmate, she's fierce.
Her caution is necessary, life hack, no fear.

Yo listen up, these sailors were shook,
As the woman told them things they'd never put in a book.
They swore an oath to keep her secret tight,
Lest her evil master should take flight.

"This story's wild", they all did say,
"Let's keep it low, don't let it stray."
They all nodded, their heads a-bobbin',
"Let's carry on, keep our business shoppin'."

The woman spoke up, a sly little grin,
"Wait for my message, load up and win."
She promised much gold, that she could collect,
And offered something that would like a charm inject.

"I care for the young master of this man's keep,
A funny little guy, don't make a peep.
Take him on board and sell him off,
A great deal of money, it'll be quite a scoff."

So the sailors agreed, to her every term,
And promised to if she did squirm.
Their plans were set, their fate a mystery,
As they awaited their fortune and history.

Oh my gosh, this story's wild, you see,
It's full of twists, and turns, and mystery.
A cunning Phoenician, with a plan so sly,
Trades a necklace of gold, without batting an eye.

He snuck in a sign just as quick as you please,
And then, before they knew it, they were off on the seas,
And this woman and boy, in their company so keen,
Were sailing across the water, all fast and so serene.

For six whole days, the journey went great,
The Phoenicians weren't tardy or ever late,
But on the seventh, Diana brought down the wrath,
And the woman was thrown overboard, a gruesome aftermath.

The ship sailed on, with the boy left alone,
Feeling quite blue, far from his home,
The winds blew fierce, the waves were high,
Until they reached Ithaca, that's no lie.

Laertes saw the boy and took pity on his case,
Using chattels to buy him, at his mercy and his grace.
That's how our hero found his way,
To Greece, where he set his roots and stayed.

Yo, Eumaeus, your life story is so real.
I'm sorry for the hardships you've had to feel.
But listen up here, Jove's got your back.
He's given you some good, despite the lack.

You've got a master who treats you right,
Makes sure you eat and drink all night.
You're living your life, feeling so fly.
While I'm still out here, just getting by.

Begging my way through every town,
Hoping someone will turn my life around.
But I gotta say, Eumaeus my friend,
I'm happy for you, till the very end. 

So let's raise a glass, cheers to your luck,
And hope one day, I can say "I'm not stuck."
Until then, Eumaeus, I'll just keep on moving,
Making my way, with nothing to be losing.

Telemachus and crew nearing land,  
Unsail the ship and take the mast in hand.  
They row the ship to harbour with care,  
Mooring stones out, they're ready to prepare.  

On the sea shore they mix their wine,  
Dinner's ready, it's looking divine.  
Telemachus speaks, "Take the ship to town,  
But leave me here, I can't leave my herdsmen down."  

"At night when I've seen all I need,  
I'll return to the city at speed.  
In return for your trouble, dinners on me.  
Meat and wine for all, it's guaranteed."  

Yo, this modern take on this ancient story,  
Is hopefully hype and not too hoary.  
In Gen-Z terms, it's a dope mix,  
With memes, slang, and all that tricks.

Oh, Theoclymenus, don't be a noob,
You're in luck, 'cause I've got the scoop,
Listen up, don't act like a fool,
I'll tell you where to go and be cool.

Among our chiefs, there's one that's lit,
His house is where you should submit,
Telemachus is his righteous name,
Don't worry, he'll treat you the same.

But if you're keen to meet my mom,
And show her that you're the bomb,
Then straight to our house you should head,
And make sure you bring some good spread.

Either way, you'll have a blast,
Make sure your vibe is totally fast,
And when you're there, just act real slick,
And don't forget to drop a quick "Yeet!"

"Dude, listen up, I know what to do,
You won't like his house, it's not for you,
My mom doesn't come around,
She stays in her loomy playground.
But fret not, I know a guy,
Eurymachus, oh my oh my,
Ithaca's best, don't you see,
He wants my mom, but he's not for me.
No one knows how it'll end,
But Eurymachus, he's a good friend."

Yo, Telemachus, check out that bird
It's flying on your right, haven't you heard?
A hawk, Apollo's quick messenger
It's got a dove, a sight to remember

And as it tears feathers off the prey
They fall like confetti, without delay
Midway 'tween the boat and where you stand
A sign from the gods, sent by their hand

Theoclymenus caught you by the hand
Said "Telemachus, this omen is grand
The bird is a message, clear as can be
Your royal power will last endlessly

No house in Ithaca will be as great
As the one owned by you, it's fate!"
So sail with hope, full of glee
As powerful as a meme, just like destiny.

Telemachus, my dude, I must applaud,
Your generosity stance is definitely not flawed.
If it all goes as planned and the gods agree,
Your presents will make them all shout with glee.

You'll show good will like a true millennial,
While your guests stuff their faces with avocado toast seminal.
And if they don't believe your hospitality is legit,
You'll drop some facts on 'em like a TikTok skit.

So keep on being a gracious host,
Offering gifts like they're some kind of boast.
And when your guests leave, their bags full,
They'll spread the word about your generosity bull.

Oh, snap, did you hear what he said?
To his friend Piraeus, he relayed.
He said, "Take this stranger to your crib,
And show him some love, like a boss and a G, that's your gig."
Piraeus, son of Clytius, always came through,
Helping his homie, that's what real friends do.
He welcomed in the stranger and treated him well,
Showing him kindness, like a lit spell.
Now, the stranger waits for his friend to return,
And for his hospitality, Piraeus earns some street cred, no concern.

Yo Telemachus, Piraeus got you, don't trip,
He'll take care of your homie, no need to flip,
Hospitality's the name of the game,
He'll make sure your boy's treated the same.

Like Spongebob says, "I'm ready, I'm ready," 
Piraeus is all about keeping your pal steady,
He'll make sure he's fed with the finest of meals,
And ensure that his stay is nothing but real.

With Piraeus around, your friend's in good hands,
Just like the Drake song, "Best I Ever Had" stands,
He's got you covered, no need to stress,
Just sit back and let him handle the rest.

As they boarded the vessel, they prepared to set sail,
Telemachus grabbed his spear, so he wouldn't fail.
They loosened the ropes and sailed on their quest,
To the city, determined to give it their best.

Telemachus dashed off as quick as he could,
He ran with his heart, hoping to reach the good.
The excellent swineherd, who's loyal and true,
He'll help Telemachus, they have much to pursue.

Countless swine roamed around the homestead,
A sight to behold, but Telemachus sped,
He needed the help of the faithful swineherd,
His trusty servant, who never says a word.

This conquest won't be a walk in the park,
Telemachus knows that, it'll be quite a remark,
But with the swineherd's help, they'll make it through,
And with it, their journey will be anew!

Hey hey, gather 'round, let me spin you a tale.
It's gonna be lit, I swear, you won't bail.

Once upon a time in the world of the web,
There lived a legendary meme that everyone said.

It was so fire, so hot, it made us LOL,
We couldn't stop laughing, it was like winning the lotto.

But then one day, a new meme came 'round,
And suddenly our hero was nowhere to be found.

We thought it was over, that our lives were ruined,
But then the OG meme came back, no longer snoozin'.

With a fresh new look and a slick new style,
It was like our fave meme had traveled for miles.

And now it's back and better than ever,
Ready to take on the internet forever.

So let this be a lesson to all you meme fiends,
Don't give up on your faves, they'll always come back it seems.

BOOK XVI

"Yo, Eumaeus, did you hear?
The dogs didn't bark, they just brought cheer.
Telemachus is here, no need to fear,
Let's make some breakfast, let's make it dear!

We've got some bacon and some eggs,
That'll put some pep in our legs.
And don't forget the coffee, my dude,
That'll get us in the right mood.

We'll sit around the fire, so cozy,
And chat about everything, no nosy.
Telemachus, we're glad you're here,
We'll make this breakfast, oh so dear." 

(Sorry if it's cringey)

Yo, Eumaeus, you hear them feet?
One of your squad, or maybe a homie we'll meet?
The dogs, they're fawning, not even one bark,
But who's headed our way? Could it be a new spark?

I'm hyped up for whoever it may be,
Maybe they'll come chill and drink some tea.
Or maybe they'll bring some fresh memes,
That will have us rolling and falling off our seams.

As soon as the words were said,
The son appeared, no longer dead!
Eumaeus jumped up with glee,
Dropped his wine, he was so happy to see!

He kissed his head and both his eyes,
And sobbed tears of joy, no disguise.
A father over the moon with elation,
To see his son's safe liberation.

He hugged and kissed him, all over with love,
Like he had come back from the heavens above.
He spoke fondly, with joy in his heart,
Thrilled to see his son not torn apart.

It's like when you find your lost Airpod,
Or getting a like from your crush on TikTok, oh my God!
So let's rejoice at this family reunion,
And welcome home the prodigal son with affection, no confusion.

Ayy, Telemachus, my sight for sore eyes
heard you went to Pylos, thought it was all lies
Come in, my boy, let's sit and chat
It's been a while since we've chewed the fat
You rarely come to see us country folk
I bet those suitors think they're woke
Think you better keep an eye on them
But enough about them, let's begin

Yo, what's poppin' T-man, 
I'm your assistant, don't forget the plan!
Let's chat about your mom,
Is she still chillin' at home like a calm?
Or did she relocate and marry,
Leavin' your dad's bed all lonely and scary?
Like cobwebs and dust,
That's not what you want, you must
Find out the truth,
So you can move on and be smooth.
Let's get this sorted,
Before the story ends up thwarted.
#Telemachus #familydrama #UlyssesWho #mamamia

Yo, Eumaeus just spilled the tea,
Penelope’s heart is shattered, can’t you see?
She’s been at home, left all alone,
Slayin' the Kleenex box, can’t stop her moan.

She’s weeping day and night,
Her heartache givin' her a fright,
Penelope’s in pain, she’s not playin',
Her tears wash away all her layin'.

Can’t nobody ease her pain,
Her weepin’ be drivin' her insane,
She needs her man, her king,
Hearin' his voice will make her heart sing.

But for now, she’s still in agony,
Prayin' for her hubby's return like a liturgy,
Eumaeus is just keepin' it real,
Penelope’s tears always keeps it 100, no chill.

Yo, the spear grabbed by stranger dude  
Came inside crossing threshold, that's dude's mood  
Ulysses stood up to give him space  
But Telemachus said "you sit down, let's ace" 

"I'll grab another seat with ease,  
While someone else sets the table, no need to tease"  
Telemachus' hospitality off the charts  
Our stranger dude's seat comfortably restarts

Telemachus, my dude, you're asking quite a bit,
This stranger's got a story, and it's gonna be lit.
He's not from around here, that's plain to see,
And the way he got here is still a mystery to me.

But one thing's for sure, he didn't arrive by foot,
He was brought here by sea, and that's the truth, so don't refute.
As for his crew, they're a ragtag bunch,
And their journey here was like a meme-filled hunch.

They faced some rough waters and a monster or two,
But they persevered and got through, and that's the clue.
Now they've landed here in our fair land,
And we'll see what fate has in store, it's all in god's hands.

So let's eat and drink, and enjoy this feast,
We'll hear this stranger's tale, and it'll be a beast.

Yo yo yo, Eumaeus my dude,
Got some lit news for you, broseph, that's true.
This Cretan traveler's been running wild,
Avoiding Thesprotians, like a scared child.

He's seeking shelter at my humble abode,
I've promised him safety, on my honor code.
But now he's yours, so do what you will,
Just remember, he came to you for a chill.

He's looking for your kindness and your care,
So go ahead, show him love, if you dare.
And if you're feeling extra kind and bold,
Offer him some food, dude, make his heart hold.

Telemachus, dude, I totally hear you out, 
It ain't safe to bring randos in, no doubt.
But since he's already here, don't stress or fear,
I got the perfect solution, loud and clear.

I'll get him some fresh threads, a sword so sharp,
And shoes that are comfy, so he won't be in the dark.
He can go wherever, he's got freedom to roam,
Or he can stay with us, and we'll make his feel at home.

But listen, bro, I gotta drop a major league warning,
Those suitors are whack, and their actions are straight-up alarming.
They act all tough, like they own the place,
Trust me, they'll treat your guest like a big disgrace.

So keep him away, from those alpha-male clowns,
They're too many in numbers, it's like they're from ghost towns.
So take my advice, and don't let them win,
We got your back, let the good vibes in!

Ulysses, bro, let me chime in,
What you're saying, man, has got us all grinnin'.
The suitors, they're so insolent,
Treating you like this, it's just not decent.
Do you just sit there and take the abuse?
Or is it a god playing a ruse?
Why don't you turn to your family, man?
They should be backing you up, that's the plan.
If only I were young again,
I'd be a force to reckon with, no pretend.
If I were Ulysses' son, or even the guy himself,
I would fight to the end, and leave no book on the shelf.
These suitors can't get away with their gross acts,
Or they'll be seeing me, and I'll hit 'em with facts.
Single-handed, I will fight,
Rather than see this injustice in sight.
For these strangers and women, let's stand up, man,
These wasted resources, and all for a sham.

Yo Eumaeus, it's me Telemachus  
Let me spill the tea, let me unleash  
My story, it's a hot mess, it's just us  
And we gotta keep it on the hush, no need to preach  

My people and I, we bear no spite  
And my brothers, they ain't the cause of our plight  
But let me tell you, my home's out of sight  
Marauders everywhere, causing me fright  

My dad's gone, and I'm his only son  
So, I'm stuck here, no good to anyone  
The chiefs from nearby, they come and have fun  
Feasting in my halls, with no shame, no pun  

They all want to woo my mom with no end  
But she won't marry, she won't even bend  
The result is, my house, they tend to spend  
Soon, they'll start on me, till they have no more to append  

The gods control it, it's out of my hand  
But, Eumaeus, please, try to understand  
Tell my mom I'm home, make sure she's the only one  
Then, come back, quick, before the day's done  

Keep our talk secret, don't shed a tear  
Because, Eumaeus, the end is near  
Thanks for listening to my story, dear  
This outcome of mine, I dread, I fear.

Hey Eumaeus, I get what you say, 
Should I let Laertes know today?
On his farm he used to roll,
Now he's been mourning, lost control.

From the time I left for Pylos,
His joy vanished, his sorrow grows.
He doesn't drink, he doesn't dine,
Looks like he'll soon run out of time.

He once was the boss of his farm,
Now he sits all day in alarm.
Crying his eyes out, wasting away,
Poor Laertes needs his spirit back today!

So, let's go now and lift his mood,
Bring back his smiles and funky attitude.
Tell him the wanderer's back in town,
His son is here, and we're holding it down.

Oh, and by the way, before I conclude,
Have you seen that new meme that's crude?
It's all over Twitter, the latest trend,
A laugh breakthrough, it never ends.

"Aye aye, captain, I hear your plea
Your pops is lost, we must set him free
But first things first, let's send a message
Don't worry, it won't cause any wreckage

Head back to base, tell 'em what's up
And do it quick, don't get caught in a holdup
Let your mom know to keep it tight
Send one of her girls to spread the light

Laertes doesn't need to know
Too many people, that's a no go
We'll find your dad with all our might
And bring him home, it'll be alright."

"Boy, don't you know me? I'm a goddess on the lowkey,
Your bae Athena, here to help you, to be your homie.
I saw you struggling with the swineherd, that's not so fly,
So I came here to hit you up and shine my light on the sly.
Eumaeus is on his way to town, I'm sure he'll do it quick,
But I'm here to tell you, Odysseus, what's real and not to be tricked.
Penelope's suitors, they're a bunch of clout chasers,
They're all after your girl, making moves and causing dangers.
But don't worry my guy, I'll give you the 411,
With my help and your skills, together we'll get it done."

Oh Ulysses, son of Laertes, 
Tell your son, don't make him wait-ies,
About your plan, to wreck the suitors 
And head to town for victory, like a scooter.

I'll be there too, no need to wonder 
Ready for the battle, like thunder,
Eager to join and show my might 
Winning this war, like every Fortnite fight.

This story's lit, it ain't no fable,
Hermes performed his magic, he's no cable.
He gave Ulysses extra drip,
Gave him new fits and made his beard flip.
The son was shook, thought it was a god,
But it's just Ulysses looking like a squad.

Sup bruh, did you just glow up? Your fit is fire and your skin's on fleek, how'd you level up so quick? Are you one of them celebs from up above? If that's the case, show love and hold off on smiting me, I'll make it up to you with a stack of cash and all the fanciest things. Please, be kind.

Ulysses is the man, he's got a plan,
He's a father to his son just like a real man.
Lawless men attack, but with his words he fights back,
No lie, that's a solid fact.

He ain't no god, don't get it twisted,
But his love for his son cannot be resisted.
He's the OG, the original gangsta,
Saving his family, that's what he's thanksta.

I gotta say, this story is lit,
Full of adventure, and Ulysses won't quit.
He's the ultimate daddy, father of the year,
Even with all the obstacles, he'll persevere.

Oh snap, dad's back and he's shedding tears,
This reunion's lit, wiping away past three years.
Telemachus stares in disbelief,
Is this really my father, it's beyond belief.

But the embrace, the kiss, it must be real,
Feels like a dream, I can't even deal.
Tears of joy streaming down their faces,
Got me feeling emotional in all the right places.

He thought his father was lost at sea,
But now he's back, and they're both wild and free.
Like Drake said, started from the bottom now we're here,
Father and son, showing love - no fear.

Oh snap, you're not my dad,
But some god is making me sad,
Giving me hope that I'll feel worse,
But this level of cool is not rehearsed.

No mere mortal could pull off this feat,
Going from old to young in a heart beat,
It must be some divine power,
Cause you're changing like a Snapchat filter after an hour.

A second ago you had a graying beard,
Now you're looking mighty fine and leered,
Like a god who's come down to Earth,
Making me feel like I've seen some real worth.

Listen up, Telemachus, this is no illusion
I'm the real Ulysses, causing confusion,
After twenty long years of tough commotion,
I'm back in my country, causing a commotion.

Don't be shocked, dude, it's me in the flesh,
Thanks to Minerva, goddess at her best,
She transforms me with such finesse,
Making me look rich or looking like a mess.

One minute a beggar, the next a young chap,
Thanks to heavens, where the gods like to nap,
Playing with me like I'm just a snap,
But I'm back, no worries, no need for a recap.

So, Telemachus, let's celebrate our reunion,
Don't be fooled, it's not an optical illusion,
It's Ulysses, the man, the legend, the fusion,
Of strength, wisdom, and some divine infusion. 
#Blessed #GoddessMode #TwentyYearsInDaMaking

Oh dang, Telemachus is feeling the feels,
His tears flowing down like the spinning Ferris wheels,
He and his father wept- oh, what a sorrowful scene,
Like two birds whose young have been stolen by a thief with a mean.
The sun was about to set with their mourning unwrapped,
Until Telemachus suddenly asked a question unwrapped,
"Yo, what ship did you come in, dear father mine?"
"What nation declared themselves, or was it all just fine?"

Okay, real talk, my dude
This story's about someone who
Got brought by Phaeacians, cool sailors
They help people out, you see, like avengers!

Ulysses was their lucky guest
Taken to Ithaca, sleeping the rest
Given gifts of gold, bronze, and bling
But now it's time, for killing!

Minerva was calling, Ulysses knew
Ithaca is where he needed to brew
A plan to fight the suitors, strong and plenty
Let's get a list, this fight won't be empty!

So, we gotta know, how many are they?
Their names, their faces, we'll slay them today!
Can we fight them all, just us two?
Or do we need more to help, to see it through?

Let's do this, Ulysses, let's win this thing
We'll make them pay, for everything
And don't worry about the gifts we'll save
They'll be waiting, in that hidden cave!

Oh my gosh, Father dear,
Your task is one that we should fear!
To go up against so many guys,
Even thinking of it makes me realize...
It's not just ten, not even twenty,
So many enemies, it's plenty.
From Dulichium, there's fifty-two,
And from Same, they bring twenty-four anew.
From Zacynthus, twenty boys,
And from Ithaca, twelve fine joys.
They bring along their servants too,
Making the situation feel like glue.
A bard and carvers for the feast,
Their power seems almost like a beast!
If we confront this many foes,
We might end up having our toes
Hurt, wounded, or worse, oh gosh,
We need help, like right now, batman, and flash!
Can you think of someone strong and true,
Who could aid us in our dreadful coup?

Yo, hear me out, let's get this straight,
Minerva and Jove, are they our fate?
Or do we need to find someone new,
To help us with the quest we pursue?

I'm not tryna be rude, but let's be real,
We need all the help we can feel.
Minerva and Jove, they may not be enough,
We gotta keep searching, it's gonna be tough.

But don't worry, I got this on lock,
I'll find us a hero that's as strong as a rock.
We'll take on this challenge, there's no fear,
And slay any obstacles that come near.

So let's get hype and keep the faith,
We'll find the one to help us ace this race.
We're gonna be legends, just wait and see,
This quest will be epic, just like me!

Oh my days, Telemachus, you're so wise,
Those allies gonna make your enemies despise.
Living high among the clouds, they're godly and lit,
Controlling both deities and mortals, they're a perfect fit.

Talking Zeus and Poseidon, they're no ordinary bros,
They can make the sea salty and throw lightning bolts for shows.
These gods are lit, upper echelon power level,
You and your homies, with them, can turn up to any revel.

Yo, listen up, it's Ulysses here  
Got a plan, gotta make it clear  
The suitors are wild, they're out of control  
Gonna need your help, gotta play a role  

Head on home, and act like before  
Swineherd will take me, out of the door  
Disguised as a beggar, I'll make my way  
And you gotta keep the suitors at bay  

Even when they're mean, and acting crass  
Just be patient, and let it pass  
But when I nod, it's time to take stock  
Hide the weapons, in the storeroom, lock!  

Excuse it by saying, "it's dirty and old"  
And moving it now, so it doesn't mold  
Say you're worried, they'll fight and get rowdy  
And the banquet will end in a manner so cloudy  

Let's keep it between us, don't tell a soul  
Not a servant or Laertes, don't give them a goal  
We'll test the maids, see who's on our side  
And find the helpers, with nothing to hide.

"Yo, pops," said Tel, "you'll see soon
That I can keep your secrets cocooned.
But hear me out, this plan ain't slick,
It won't save either of us quick.
We'll be chasin' farms and men all day,
While the suitors chew your estate like hay.
Sure, test the women, weed out the bad,
But testing the men? That can wait a tad.
If Jove blesses you with a sign,
We can do that investigation in due time."

Yo, Telemachus made it back to Ithaca town
The ship docked and they all hopped on the ground
Their servants took their gear, they're worry-free
Presents were left at Clytius's house, don't you see?

Then a servant was sent to tell Penelope
To prevent her from being alarmed, oh so meek
And Eumaeus met him, they both had the same intent
To deliver the news, make sure she felt content

The servant stood up and spoke for all to hear
"Madam, your son's back, have no fear"
But Eumaeus went to Penelope, oh so sly
And whispered "Telemachus told me to say hi"

After the message was delivered oh so neat
Eumaeus headed back to the pigs and the bleat.

Yo, the suitors were tight,
After what happened last night,
They went outside to vent their anger and fear,
And held a council, trying to figure out what's near.

Eurymachus, son of Polybus, spoke first,
Trying to be cool, but obviously cursed,
He said, "What the heck just happened in there?"
"We gotta do something, this ain't fair!"

The others nodded, can't deny their frustration,
But Antinous, the leader, had a sick determination,
"We gotta find a way to get rid of that guy,"
Else he'll spoil our party, leave us high and dry.

So they plotted and schemed, thinking they're so slick,
But little did they know, their end's coming quick,
Cause Odysseus is set to take them down,
And claim his wife, his throne, and his crown.

"Yo homies," he spoke, "Telemachus's voyage is no joke,
We thought it would flop and end up broke.
But now let's get lit, set sail and row,
Gather a squad, and tell the rest to go."

"We'll slide that ship into the water with grace,
And summon a crew to keep up the pace.
We'll tell them to come back, move quick and fly,
Like memers and gamers when they're streaming high."

"You feel me, fam? Let's make this happen,
And keep Telemachus from gettin' nappin.'
We'll hit up the high seas, and we'll do it tight,
Like when we playin' Fortnite all night."

Oh snap, that's what's up,
Amphinomus saw the ship and all of a sudden stopped.
He laughed so hard, you could hear from miles away,
"They're here y'all, no need to send a message today!"
He thinks a god might have let them know,
Or is it possible they just couldn't catch the ship's flow?

Yo, listen up crew, we're here at the bay
Let's get off this ship, it's time to say hey
Our servants take our armor and we hit the shore
And come to the assembly to hear what's in store

Antinous, son of Eupeithes, takes the mic
Speaks first, causes tension, just like a hype
No young or old allowed, he sets the rules
But we new kids on the block, ain't no fools

We'll speak our minds, with memes and slang
Antinous, we won't let you hang
Our generation's got something to say
We'll do it our way, every single day.
