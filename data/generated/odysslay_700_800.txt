Alright, alright, check it out fam,
This dude here, he's like a calamity, a ram
We thought we had him, we were so keen,
But damn, he's been saved, if you know what I mean.

The gods, they had his back, it wasn't our day,
We waited all night, hoping he'd stray,
But no, he made it home, safe and sound,
And now we gotta catch him, we can't let him be found.

He's smart, he knows things that'll make us rot,
And if we don't act quick, we might just get caught,
We gotta do something, before he speaks up,
Before the people learn the truth, and get fed up.

So, let's lay low, and make a sly plan,
To grab him before he gets to his fam,
Divide his things amongst us, real quick,
And leave his mom and her man with the castle, lickety-split.

But, hold up, hold up, that ain't our only option,
We can't be eating up his goods, and causing a commotion,
We can offer Penelope's hand, from where we stand,
And whoever pays the most, can get the girl and land.

Yo listen up, my dudes, Amphinomus is speaking,
But his words got me wondering and even peeking.
He says he doesn't wanna bring Telemachus down,
And honestly, that's chill and makes him the coolest around.

This son of Nisus is from Dulichium,
A place that's wheat-growing, so he's got a good axiom.
He talks to Penelope like he's her bestie,
And his kind disposition is what makes him the messie.

Let's take counsel from the gods, he says,
And if they advise it, we can slay him in many ways.
But if they don't, then we shouldn't kill that lad,
And instead, we should all be sad. 

Amphinomus, my bro, you're a true G,
Your words are like music, trust me, they're the key.
Let's all listen to your wise advice,
And not forget that hurting noble blood isn't nice.

Oh wow, did you hear what he said? 
It got them out of bed and straight ahead.
They headed to the house of Ulysses, 
And sat down in their usual thrones with much successes. 

It's lit, it's hype, it's just their scene, 
Going to Ulysses' house like they're the queen and kings.
They sit and chat and make merry, 
Like it's a party and they're not wary. 

This crew knows how to have fun, 
Taking it easy and all undone. 
With Ulysses' home as their go-to spot, 
You know it's always going to be lit, non-stop!

Penelope came through and made the suitors shook,  
She knew their plan, no time for mistook,  
She walked down with her maidens in tow,  
Ready to call out the suitors' deadly blow.  

She stood by the post, her face veiled with care,  
And spoke to Antinous with a bold, mighty air,  
"You've caused enough trouble, as it is quite clear,  
Leave my home at once or ready to face the fear."  

The suitors were silent, for they knew her power  
Penelope, a queen, in her finest hour,  
She would not back down, nor give up her throne,  
For beneath it all, she had strength that's shown.  

So with her voice firm and her spirit high,  
Penelope stood tall as the suitors passed by,  
From that day forth, they dare not defy,  
For they knew she could have them say goodbye.  

And that's the story of Penelope great,  
The queen who stood tall and sealed her fate,  
May we all learn from her strength and might,  
And use it to push forward, and stand up for what's right.

Oh wow, Antinous, you speak so well,
But seriously, what's up with this hell?
Trying to scheme and take out a king,
Without a care for anything.
Why ignore the pleas of the divine,
Messing around is crossing the line!
Don’t forget when pops was on the run,
From folks who wanted to make him undone.
Ulysses saved the day with his grace,
But you act like it's some kind of race.
Taking things that aren't meant to be yours,
And trying to make Telemachus do chores.
Come on now, this is too insane,
Stop playing these wicked games!


Oh snap, did you hear that flow? 
Eurymachus thinks he's in control, 
But Telemachus has nothing to fear, 
His safety is just so clear. 

This shady dude thinks he's so slick, 
But his spear will soon be causing a bit of a prick. 
Telemachus is like family, 
Eurymachus can't harm him, you see. 

Penelope, don't you worry, 
Your son will be safe and sound, don't hurry. 
Eurymachus is just frontin', 
And his plot against Telemachus will soon be nothin'. 

Ulysses may be gone, 
But his son is strong, he won't be done. 
Eurymachus will soon feel the wrath, 
And his plot will come to a quick path. 

So don't trip, Penelope, everything's cool, 
Telemachus is chillin', he ain't no fool. 
Eurymachus will soon be defeated, 
And Telemachus' victory will be completed.

As the night approached and the pork was on fire,
Ulysses and his son made their dinner attire,
But then came goddess Minerva, so sly and so quick,
She transformed him old, just like a neat magic trick.

The swineherd approached, Eumaeus by name,
And he had no idea of Ulysses’ game,
Minerva's spell was on him so strong,
As Ulysses held his disguise all along. 

Penelope mourned for so many years,
Until Minerva wiped away her tears,
She shed sleep over her eyes with such ease,
Like a boss making everything feel like a breeze. 

The story's getting lit with each passage and verse,
Full of culture and memes, this story is diverse,
Gen-Z and Millennials will love to know,
How Ulysses tricked his foes and put on a show.

Ooh, Telemachus, you coming in hot,
Asking 'bout the town, what's the plot?
Are the suitors back, or are they still vibin',
Waiting over yonder, their plans connivin'?

Eumaeus, bro, what's the word on the street?
Don't leave us hangin', we need to eat
These suitors are thirsty for my throne,
But I ain't gonna give it up, no way, no how, no moan.

Are they still waiting like a bunch of clowns,
Or have they finally left town?
You gotta tell me, man, I need to know,
Before I can plan my next move and go.

So spill the tea, Eumaeus, don't be shy,
We're all ears, no need to lie.
The future of Ithaca is on the line,
And I won't give it up, not even for a dime.

"Bro, you missed out on the tea,"
Eumaeus replied with a plea.
"I just went to give my message, 
Didn't think there'd be any presage. 

I met a man from Pylos town, 
He was the one who wore the crown. 
He was first to tell your mother, 
But I still wanted to uncover. 

Once I climbed the hill of Mercury, 
I could see the ship come in fairly clearly. 
Men with spears and shields it bore, 
I thought it was the suitors for sure."

Oh snap, Telemachus the OG
Smiling at his father, that's a sight to see
Eumaeus can't peep, but he's still around
Holding it down like a boss, he's so profound

Aye aye, they did their work with might and main,
And after the feast, they were far from plain!
They feasted and rested, feeling so blessed,
Hadn't been that relaxed since the TikTok ban unrest.

With stomachs stuffed full like the Thanksgiving bird,
They retreated to rest, not saying a word.
Each one got his fair share, they were all content,
Sleeping like babies and dreams heaven sent.

With the moon shining bright,
They entered the land of the night,
The work was done, the table set,
This is the dream we cannot forget!

What's up my internet friends, let me tell you a tale
A story so fire, it'll never go stale
It's got some drama, it's got some spice
And I swear on my memes, it's worth your time on this slice

So listen up peeps, let me set the stage
It all went down on a Twitter page
A feud was brewing, and man it was big
Two celebs throwing shade, like they're trig

One of them dropped a subtweet so sly
The other retorted, "I ain't gonna lie"
And then it escalated, as it tends to do
The clapbacks were lit, like a firework or two

But then things got crazy, they started a trend
Fans and haters were all up in that blend
The mentions were blowing up, it was insane
Like a viral meme, it spread like rain

And in the end, they made up and hugged it out
A happy ending, without a doubt
But the lesson we learned from this Twitter beef
Always keep it classy, and never bring the heat

So there it goes, my story's complete
I hope you enjoyed it, and stayed on your feet
Remember to stay tuned for more pop culture hype
Until next time, peace out, and goodnight!

BOOK XVII

Yo swineherd, listen up, 
I gotta go and see my mom and that's what's up.
I need to show my face, 
And end my mother's constant grieving pace.

But this poor stranger, so down on his luck, 
Take him to the town, let him try his luck. 
He can beg for some bread or maybe a drink, 
Though I don't wanna add to my troubles, I need time to think. 

If he gets mad, that’s his problem, not mine, 
I have my own issues, they're not benign. 
But nobody can say I'm not truthful and fair, 
I'll speak my mind even if it's rare.

Yo, Ulysses was like, "Sir,
I ain't stayin' here, that's for sure.
A beggar like me can make a killin' in town,
People will give, they'll never let you down.

I'm too old for this, I need some fun,
Being a servant ain't for everyone.
So let your dude take me to the city,
But first, let me get warm, it's cold and gritty.

These clothes are trash, they won't keep me hot,
And this frosty morning will totally be my death spot.
So let me warm up by the fire,
And then we'll go - I ain't no liar." 

Like, hello! Ulysses is a boss,
He won't freeze - that would be a total loss.
He wants to hit the town and live it up,
People will help him out, fill his cup.

Telemachus walked with pride,
Vengeful thoughts he couldn't hide.
He made his way to his place,
And put his spear against the case.

He walked the halls with a stride,
His anger he couldn't abide.
He got inside with determined haste,
And crossed the stone floor with great taste.

He brooded on, nothing could deter,
As he sharpened his skills à la John Wick, for sure!
He was determined to get his revenge,
And wouldn't stop until the very end.

Yo, Nurse Euryclea saw Odysseus first, 
Putting fleeces on the seats, she almost burst. 
She cried and ran up to him, 
Covered him with kisses, so much vim. 

All the other maids followed her lead, 
Showing love for their king, indeed. 
Penelope, like Venus, came out to see, 
Wept with joy, hugging her son so free. 

She kissed his forehead, his beautiful eyes, 
Saying, "Light of my eyes," with no disguise. 
She wondered why he went to Pylos alone, 
"Tell me what you saw," she said with a groan.

"Don't trip, my lady," replied Tel, 
"I nearly died, but I'm alive and well. 
So freshen up and raise the stakes, 
And let's ask the gods to aid our revenge that's at stake. 

Now, I gotta dip to the public place, 
To invite a stranger I met in the chase. 
I sent him ahead with the rest of the crew, 
Piraeus will keep him safe, don't worry it's true." 

*inserts cool meme here, but doesn't forget to rhyme*

She listened to her son's plea,
And decided to take revenge, you see.
She washed her face, changed her look,
And promised the gods a full hecatomb book.

She wanted to make the suitors pay,
And prayed the gods would make them sway.
With her fierce determination high,
She made a vow to the gods in the sky.

And if they helped her in her quest,
She’d offer them hecatombs, oh so blessed.
So let's wait and see what happens next,
Will the suitors fall or will they flex?

Oh my god, Telemachus on the move,
With his dogs, sleek and smooth.
He walks in, looking divine
All the suitors’ hearts do pine.

But he’s not interested in their croon,
He goes to hang with Antiphus and Halitherses soon.
Piraeus comes with Theoclymenus in tow,
Asking Telemachus to return Menelaus’ presents, you know.

Telemachus, what a legend like Keanu,
Sure, Piraeus, I’ll get the presents to you.
But don’t think I’ll let the suitors win,
I’ll get rid of them, like cleaning up spam in my bin.

Yo, Telemachus speaking facts 
I don't know what's up with these suitors and their acts
They might end up killing me in my own crib 
But at least my presents won't end up in their greedy grip 

If I end up slaying these fools 
I'll need you to bring me my jewels 
I appreciate your concern 
But bro, these suitors are about to crash and burn 

No cap, I'm not backing down 
I won't let these suitors wear the crown 
Either way, Piraeus, you're the real one 
I trust you to see the job done 

I gotta bounce now and face my fate 
But thanks for having my back, mate 
Telemachus out, peace sign emoji 
I'll catch you on the flip side, stay cozy.

Yo, Theoclymenus, welcome to the crib,
Let's wash up, then grub, get some food bib.
The maids will anoint us and give us some cloaks,
Then we'll sit and eat, no need for jokes.

A maid servant pours water in the basin,
For us to wash our hands, no time for chasing.
We munch on bread and other good food,
Penelope spinning, setting the mood.

After we ate, Penelope spoke,
Her voice so calm, like a decent bloke.
"My suitors are trash, they won't take the hint,
But I have a plan, it's time to mint."

Theoclymenus and Odysseus sat in awe,
Penelope's plan, they were ready to draw.
They vowed to help, take down those lames,
And free Penelope from their wicked games.

Yo, Telemachus, lemme take a nap
On that couch that brings *feels* like a trap
I've cried enough tears to create a river
Since the day Ulysses left, no lie, I shiver
But before those suitors came with their blunder
Did you hear a thing about your father's thunder?

"Okay listen up, let me tell you a tale,
About a hero who was thrown in jail,
Ulysses they called him, a man of great might,
But he vanished from sight, like he took flight.

His son said to his mom, 'We went to seek dad,'
But even Nestor, that old chap, looked sad,
He hadn't heard of him, alive or deceased,
And oh, the truth was such a pain to feast.

So we went to Menelaus's, and lo and behold,
Helen was there, shining like gold,
Menelaus asked us, 'Why are you here,'
And the son spoke the truth, no need for fear.

But Menelaus was enraged, a terrible sight to see,
He said, 'Those suitors are cowards, they don't let him be,
If Ulysses were here, he'd throw punches and kicks,
Make those wimps suffer, make them do tricks!'

And then he spoke of a tale from the sea,
How Ulysses was captive, we all should agree,
Trapped by Calypso, in her lovely home,
Missing his wife, unable to roam.

So now we know, he's alive and well,
Stuck on an island, with a mighty spell,
But with the gods on our side, and a bit of luck,
We'll bring him home, no more stuck in the muck."

"Girl, this guy's words are dope,
they're sweeter than a scope of Pope.
Listen up and hear his flow,
it's lit like a shooting star's glow.

He's got game like Kobe,
his finesse is oh so snowy.
Penelope, don't you see,
this guy's the real MVP.

He's smoother than butter,
his words make you flutter.
He's a snack, a whole feast,
his charm will never cease.

So don't play him for a fool,
girl, he's no one's tool.
Choose this man - he's a king,
he'll keep you living like it's spring."

Aye ma'am, wife of Ulysses, hear me rap
Yo boy Telemachus don't know 'bout that
Let me drop it like it's hot, no cap
Jove the king of heaven is my witness, I'll unwrap

The truth 'bout Ulysses, in Ithaca he's chillin'
Whether he's traveling or still nowhere willin'
He's aware of these suckers, his plan's fulfillin'
He'll make them pay, his anger's billin'

An omen I saw while on the ship
And to Telemachus, I let it rip
Girl, ain't no need to lose your grip
Your man's comin' back, let your fantasies rip

So don't worry madam, just take a breath
Soon enough Ulysses will face those pests
And you can put all your fears to rest
For he'll come out triumphant, and they'll fail the test.

Yo, Penelope is a queen of old,
But her words still ring with stories untold.
"If your words come true," she did say,
"I'll give you gifts to make your day."

Penelope's promise is lit,
Her good will and gifts quite legit.
With these blessings, you'll surely shine,
A hero of the internet's design.

So make your words come true, my friend,
And let Penelope's kindness never end.
May you be blessed with countless memes,
And all the good fortune of your dreams.

Yo yo yo, let's get hype,
These suitors got no type.
Throwing discs and aiming spears,
Behaving with all their old peers.

But wait, it's time for grub,
Bring in the flock, there's the rub.
Our servant Medon is the best,
He'll hook up dinner, no need to stress.

Dinner time, let's not forget,
It's the best meal, no need to fret.
So let's go eat and have some fun,
These suitors won't have any bun.

Aye, it's lit, let's go to town,
Don't wanna make my boss man frown.
The sheep, goats, pigs, and heifer we'll lay,
But we gotta leave, can't delay.

Swineherd, my man, I feel ya vibe,
But gotta listen to my master's jive.
Staying here would've been super cool,
But I can't ignore the boss man's rule.

Day's bright, gotta make the move,
But night's lurking, we gotta groove.
Don't wanna get caught in the cold,
Gotta head to town, so we're not sold.

It's a vibe, a lifestyle, we keepin' it real,
Gotta do what we gotta do, and seal the deal.
So let's head out, and don't you interrupt,
And we'll hit up the town, and roll with the flux.

Yo, Ulysses, your request is clear as day,
You wanna walk smooth, not stumble and sway.
So let's get a move on, no need for extensions,
But if there's a stick, then give me that extension.

The road you speak of is said to be tough,
But we got this handled, ain't no reason to huff.
With a stick in my hand, I'll walk with some pep,
And make it look easy, like nothing's a step.

So let's hit the road and make our way,
Ulysses and me, ready to slay.
No need to worry or fuss and fret,
Cause we got this in the bag, we won't break a sweat.

As they journeyed, the swineherd led the way,
Ulysses walked behind, looking like a stray.
His tattered wallet hung around his neck,
And his clothes were all ragged, a total wreck.

As they approached the fountain, what a sight to see,
Poplars standing in a circle, all pretty as can be.
Water flowed down from a rock so high,
At the altar to the nymphs, Ulysses let out a sigh.

But alas, Melanthius arrived, quite rude,
With his goats and shepherds, a pretty big brood.
He spewed outrageous words in Ulysses’ direction,
Making him seethe with anger, no need for reflection.

Oh snap! Melanthius, you better watch your tongue,
Or Ulysses will make you wish you had never begun.
He may look like a tramp, but don’t be fooled,
For in disguise, Ulysses is pretty cool.


Hey hey, did you hear what he had to say?
About a guy who begs for scraps all day?
He called him a poor miserable creature,
Said he's not fit to sit at the table as a feature.

This guy never won any contest or prize,
And now he roams around tells only lies.
Rubbing his shoulders against every door post,
Begging for food as if it's something to boast.

But hey, if you give him to me I won't mind,
He can clean out the stables or bring some grind,
Fatten up as much as he likes with whey,
As long as he doesn't go begging all day.

This guy is taking the wrong path,
Won't do any work or take a bath.
The people living near Ulysses' home,
Will throw stools at him to make him roam.

So don't be like him, don't beg for scraps,
Work hard towards your goals, and build new paths.
Don't let anything stop you from reaching the stars,
And don't beg for food like you're behind iron bars.

Yo, as Ulysses passed by,
Melanthius gave a kick, oh my!
But Ulysses stayed in his lane,
Not letting his anger be profane.

For a sec, he thought of attacking,
Melanthius with his staff, no lacking.
Or beat him up, and watch him fall,
But he kept himself in check, he's not small.

The swineherd's eyes locked onto Melanthius,
Rebuking him, feeling quite righteous.
He lifted his hands, praying up to heaven,
Being the bigger person, and forgiving rather than.

Wow, these dudes need to chill,
Like outdated memes that need to be still.
Let's move on from this ancient land,
And head to where the cool kids stand.

"Ok boomer," I quipped, "your rant is like ancient literature.
But your prayer seems legit, let's hope it's not a failure.
Ulysses needs some mad help, to put those nymphs in their place.
These shepherds are clowning, leaving their flocks lost in space.

Let's hope the gods listen, and send him home real quick.
Or else those flocks will die and it'll be sickeningly tragic.
So keep that faith alive, and let your hope carry on.
Maybe Ulysses will grace us with his presence at dawn."

Hey, Melanthius, don't be a hater,
Let's not be a disrespectful debater!
Talking smack to an old friend's son,
That's just not cool, it's not fun.

Selling Ulysses' son, are you insane?
You'll end up with money but you'll feel the pain.
Wishing for Apollo to strike him dead?
That's just way too much hate to be fed.

And as for Ulysses, you doubt his return?
His patience and intelligence are ones to learn.
He'll come home soon, you'll see and know,
Until then, your negativity can hit the road.

So let's spread kindness, peace, and love,
Like a sweet tweet from a cute dove.
No more insults or wishing ill,
Let's come together, let's chillax and be still.

As they walked up to the house divine
Swaying to the rhythm of Phemius' rhyme
Ulysses and the swineherd met the feast
With hungry hearts, their stomachs to appease

Eurymachus saw Ulysses there
And gave him a nod, a sign that was rare
Out of all the suitors, he was the best
The one who treated him far from a pest

As the servants brought him a piece of meat
Ulysses felt his hunger retreat
The upper woman served him bread so sweet
Like a true king, he began to eat

Then he grabbed the swineherd's hand with delight
And spoke these words with all his might
"I am Ulysses, your king and lord,
Returned at last with my trusty sword."

Yo Eumaeus, this crib of Ulysses is so tight,
No matter where you go, it's hard to find a sight
Like this dope house with its battlement wall,
Double doors lit, it's impossible to fall.

The sound of music coming from inside,
Along with the scent of roast meat so fried,
It appears that within there's some lit party,
The gods themselves would join with nobody.

Ulysses' pad is the talk of the town,
The opulence and luxury of which, astounds.
With one building following another,
Eumaeus, you'll never find a place as proper.

Eumaeus, my dude, you make a fair point
But you gotta level up if you wanna join this joint
Do you go first, or should I take the lead?
Either way, we gotta move with lightning speed.

The suitors are wildin' and they're up to no good
We gotta be careful, and we gotta be shrewd
So here's what we do, let's switch up the plan
I'll go in first, and make them understand.

But don't worry, my friend, I won't leave you behind
Together, you and I, we're one of a kind
We'll navigate the chaos, we'll come out on top
And when it's all over, we'll fist bump and bop.

So let's do this thing, let's get it started
We'll show these suitors that we're not to be parted
No throwing things or acting like jerks
We'll outsmart them all, like true internet gurus.

Yo, I'm your cool assistant and you're in luck  
I'll hype up your story with no chill, let's see what we've struck  
Ulysses replied with wisdom so tight  
He said, "Bruh, I've been through lots of fight"  

He's been through wars and wild oceans too  
Beaten and thrown at, he knows how to go through  
But there's one enemy he can't fend  
A hungry belly, his enemy and friend  

People sail the seas with ships so fine  
And make war on others with swords that shine  
Why, you ask? My bad, let me explain  
To fill their bellies and live with no pain  

Ulysses is wise and knows what to do  
He's got this, trust me, fam, it's true  
So listen up, let's end this tale  
Ulysses is a boss, he'll always prevail.

A loyal dog, what a good boy!
Looks like Argos, full of joy!
Ulysses bred him, a hunting hound,
But now he's left lying on the ground.
Neglected and covered in fleas,
His master gone, he's full of unease.
As Ulysses stands there, tears in his eyes,
Argos wags his tail, he won't disguise.
He wants to get close, to lick his hand,
But he can't move, he can barely stand.
Ulysses knows him, with a heart heavy as lead,
But Eumaeus is clueless, as he scratches his head.

Aye, that hound is lit, can't you tell?
His bod's so solid, he's practically swell!
But is he legit or just a fake?
Does he mooch off scraps for his own sake?

Don't trip, homie, he's the real deal,
A noble pup with some mad appeal.
He don't beg or bargain for a seat,
He's too cool for that, he's got his own beat! 

So show that dog some major love,
He's not just some accessory with fur and a glove.
He's a top dog, a king, a boss,
And his loyalty? It's at no cost!

Yo, this doggo here
Belonged to someone we held quite dear.
If he were as strong as he was
Back when Odysseus set off for the Trojan war, just because,
Nothing in the jungle could outdo him, that's no lie.
But alas, times have changed and no one gives him a try.
Since his owner is no more,
The servants don't care, they just ignore.
Whenever a master's gone,
The slaves just don't get their work done.
Jove steals half of a man's spirit
When he becomes a slave, that's just how demigods hear it.

Yo, my peeps, let me tell you a tale
Of Odysseus and his loyal canine, oh so pale
As the hero spoke, he ventured inside
Where suave suitors vied for his bride

But as he entered, his heart was grave
For his faithful dog laid still as a grave
Argos, his name, recognized his master's scent
But alas, he passed on, too weak to vent

This scene is straight out of Greek mythology,
But let's give our respects to Argos, okay, continuously
He may just be a dog, but his loyalty was real
Rest in peace, Argos, now let's just curb our zeal.

Telemachus, my dude, spied Eumaeus first,
And motioned him towards him, for he was thirst
To chill and chat with his loyal swineherd friend
A seat was found and Eumaeus did descend

He peeped the food scene and began to feast
grabbing some bread, he took a bite at least
The servant was quick to serve up the best
And Eumaeus was ready to take on the test

But what caught his eye was the suitors at play
Telemachus' foes, who were there every day
Eumaeus thought, "oh how the tables will turn,
When Odysseus returns and those fools will learn."

Yo, as Ulysses walked in the place,
He looked like a poor, old disgrace.
In ragged clothes and leaning on a pole,
He entered the court feeling so droll.

Sitting on the threshold, miserable and grim,
Against a cypress-wood post, cool and slim.
Telemachus gave him meat and bread,
Said to Eumaeus, "Let's help him get ahead."

He told the stranger to go ask the suitors,
And to be bold, not have any rumors.
"A beggar must not be ashamed," he said,
And with this wisdom, he sent him ahead.

But as the story goes on and on,
Ulysses proves he's a don,
A hero with a plan so strong,
That every suitor will sing a sad song.

From poor and lost, he will rise to fame,
And win back his home and his wife's sweet name.
Stay tuned for more of this epic tale,
Where Ulysses' cunning will certainly prevail!

Oh word, Eumaeus just dropped a bomb,
Telemachus is sending the stranger on,
To beg the suitors, gotta bring it on,
Beggars shouldn't be ashamed, that's what's going on. 

No cap, the suitors deserve to be played,
For their rude behavior, they gotta get slayed.
But the stranger can't be feeling dismayed,
Gotta hustle and beg until he gets paid.

Telemachus knows what's up, he's a real one,
Sending the stranger to get the job done.
No fake news, just facts, they gotta shun,
Any shame or embarrassment, and have some fun.

So let's get lit, the stranger's gotta go hard,
Start begging like a boss, no holds barred.
And if anyone tries to disregard,
Remind them you're a boss, disregard the retards.

My dude Ulysses, he's got class,
Wishing Telemachus joy, that's top brass.
King Jove better grant that kid's wish ASAP,
If not, we'll have to send him a sad react.

Telemachus' heart's desire, let it come true,
Ulysses knows the gods'll see it through.
Hope he gets what he wants, that'd be lit,
If not, we'll have to throw some shade and just sit.

May the gods bless this homie's quest,
Make sure he passes every test.
We'll pray to the ancient Greek divines,
And leave the rest in their hands, that's just fine.

Ulysses begged from the bros,
Asking for bread, you know how it goes.
He wanted to see who was rotten and who was pure,
He wanted to know who was rich and who was poor.

Some suitors felt for his plight,
They wondered who he was into the night.
Melanthius chimed in with his two cents,
But he didn't know much sense.

Ulysses kept begging from left to right,
Hoping to spot the ones not right.
Minerva watched over him with a grin,
Knowing not one of them would win.

Ulysses was on a mission,
To identify the bad with precision.
But the suitors were in for a surprise,
As Ulysses was great with disguise.

Oh boy, Antinous is getting crude,  
Talking smack like a total dude.  
"Why bring this man to our humble abode?  
We already have enough bums on the road!"  

He's dissing the swineherd, what a shame,  
Blaming him for bringing a stranger to the game.  
But we all know it's just an excuse to hate,  
Making up nonsense, just to berate.  

Maybe Antinous should cool it down a bit,  
And show some kindness, instead of throwing a fit.  
Life's too short to be so mean,  
Let's spread love like peanut butter and jelly, if you know what I mean.  

#SorryNotSorry, I got carried away,  
But kindness is key every single day.  
So let's all take a deep breath and chill,  
We can change the world if we just sit still.

Antinous my dude, your diss was rude,
Don't forget Eumaeus has got attitude.
He didn't invite this stranger, straight up,
Only those with skills get a welcome cup.

Your kind words are few, Antinous,
So let's give credit where it's due, genius.
A seer, a healer, or a bard's song,
Those are the ones who always belong.

Ulysses' servants, you're always on their case,
But Eumaeus isn't worried about your disgraced face.
As long as Telemachus and Penelope stay alive here,
Eumaeus won't be bullied by your mocking sneer.

Oh, snap, Telemachus ain't wrong
Antinous be spittin' fire all day long
Hating on all the suitors with a bitter tongue
Making their vibes worse, that's just wrong

Telemachus knows how to keep it cool
Antinous' negativity, he don't wanna fuel
Hush, don't answer him, that's the rule
Let him talk, we'll just sip our brew

But seriously, Antinous needs to chill
Bringing everyone down, it's a thrill
Why you gotta be so negative still?
Get on board, or get out, for real

Anyway, back to the story
The suitors be actin' all hoary
Telemachus won't let 'em steal his glory
He's the man, no need to worry.

Antinous, my dude, you act like I'm your son
Why you gotta treat this stranger like he's done?
Come on, take something and give it to him with care
I don't mind, my pockets are full, I'll share.

Don't worry 'bout my mom or the other help
I trust you, my man, you won't make me yelp
But I know you like eating, you're a foodie
Don't keep it to yourself, be kind and share the goodies.

Antinous, don't be a hater,
Telemachus has got some flavor,
You gotta give him props,
He's no regular shop.

Don't let your jealousy show,
Or else it's gonna blow,
Telemachus ain't no fool,
He's got moves that are cool.

If all the suitors were like you,
Their attitude would be so blue,
But Telemachus doesn't need your coin,
He's got his own shine and joy.

So don't be a negative meme,
And let Telemachus' aura beam,
You know he's the one with the swag,
And that's something we can't drag.

Yo, Antinous, you gotta hear me out,
You and these suitors gotta get out,
Ulysses is back and he's not happy,
Don't you see his expression so scrappy?

I know you gave me some bread and meat,
But let's be real, Ulysses is sweet,
You guys gotta peace out of this place,
Or else you'll end up in a disgrace.

I'm just the loyal goatherd here,
But I can sense Ulysses' fear,
He's ready to throw down that stool,
And make you all look like a fool.

So take my advice and just leave,
Or else Ulysses will make you heave,
And that's no cap, that's straight facts,
You don't wanna mess with his acts.

Hey homie, throw me something free,

you're no doubt the big cheese,

you're a VIP, a leader, on top of your game -

so share the love, and earn some fame!

I used to be loaded, a big shot, a boss,

had a crib so fly it was covered in gloss.

I'd give to the needy, no matter who,

my hands were open, my heart true blue.

I had it all, servants and twirls,

shiny wheels, diamonds and pearls.

But life took a turn, fate had its way,

and I was sent packing, far, far away.

Now I'm wandering, a beggar and thief,

trying to scrounge up some clothes and relief.

I see you there, with your riches galore,

and I pray that you'll open up your door.

Throw some coin, a little more,

and I'll tell the world of your generous roar.

In the past, I gave what I could,

no questions asked, I did what I should.

But now, I'm down on my luck,

my ships are stranded, my pockets stuck.

So please sir, don't be unkind,

help me out, and you'll be on my mind.

Like Drake said, I'm upset and alone,

but with your help, I'll find my way home.

Yo, let me tell you a tale so scary,
It'll make you wanna flee to the prairie.
These dudes, they didn't follow orders,
And took things into their own borders.

They wreaked havoc on Egyptian land,
Killed men and seized houses unplanned.
The city got wind and came out fighting,
Soldiers and horses, armour so blinding.

But then Jove decided to spread fear,
My men petrified, enemies so near.
We were surrounded, no way out,
The Egyptians took their murderous clout.

They took some of us alive as slaves,
The rest met with deathly graves.
But me, they gave away like a used car,
To a guy named Dmetor, who lived on Cyprus afar.

And now I'm here, telling my tale so sad,
Wondering how my luck has turned out so bad.
But always remember, when disobedience is near,
Disaster and chaos is always near. #StayFrosty.

Antinous was acting super rude
Like he had something to prove
He called the beggar a pest
But he's just trying to digest

The food that the suitors devour
While the beggar eats scraps by the hour
Antinous wanted him out of their sight
Thinking he was wrong for asking if they had a bite

He threatened to give him Egypt and Cyprus
As if that would stop him from being zealous
The other suitors gave him what he needed
But Antinous acted like he was super conceited

Ulysses, you so slick,
Your words are giving me a kick.
This man's manners, they're pretty weak,
For someone who's got plenty to eat.

He's rude and impolite,
Not even willing to share a bite.
If he was in his own abode,
He'd never offer up a loaf or a toad.

This guy's got no class,
Not even a smidge or a tad.
Ulysses, you're the boss,
Making him look like a cad.

So let's bounce from this lame-o,
Find someone who's a friend-o.
We'll have some laughs and chow,
And leave this guy with a big wow.

Oh snap, Antinous thought he had the power
But Ulysses stood strong, didn't even cower
He threw a footstool, aiming for the kill
But our boy Ulysses, he ain't feel the chill

He brooded in silence, his mind in revenge
Antinous, you messed with the wrong hombre, my friend
Ulysses went back and he sat at the door
Wallet at his feet, he ain't taking no more

He's chillin' and waiting for what's to come
Antinous better watch out, he's in for a bum
It's not over yet, Ulysses will get his pay
For the footstool that hit him, on that fateful day

Bro, hear my plea, all you suitors of Penelope the queen,
I speak my mind with passion, let me make it scene.
A man ain't feel no pain, no ache, when battles are fought for gold,
Or his sheep or cattle, so I'm told.

But Antinous hit me, I'm hurt in the heart,
My belly grows empty, as if from the start.
If the poor have gods, if we're not just a bummer,
I pray they bring Antinous to a bad slumber.

Let justice rain down, and make him pay,
For messing with me in such an awful way.
I'll keep my hopes up, and my head held high,
And wait for the day when he'll finally comply.

#OhSnap #JusticeForMe #AntinousBeLike #NotYourPunchingBag #PrayForThePoor #GreekMythsGang

Oh snap, Antinous be acting like a clown
Telling Telemachus to shut up and sit down
Talking 'bout "eat your victuals in silence"
And threatening him with a punishment that's violent

But hold up, why you gotta be so extra?
And show no respect to this young protector
Telemachus got manners, unlike you, dude
And he's not afraid to speak the truth, too

Antinous ain't got no chill nor class
Talking like he's the king of this palace
But Telemachus won't back down or flee
From this sorry excuse for a VIP

So Antinous, you better watch your back
Before Telemachus puts you in your place, smack
And shows you who's the real boss of this ship
And that your petty attitude can take a trip. #humblebrag #youdoyou #slay

Oh wow, Antinous, who gave you the right? 
You hit that poor man with all your might.
What if he's a god, in disguise and all? 
You better watch your back and not be so tall. 
Gods can come as travelers, let that be clear. 
They roam the earth to check what's wrong and what's dear.
Don't underestimate a man by their appearance, 
Or else you'll be in for some serious interference.

Hold up, stop the press!
Telemachus is feeling quite distressed
His anger is brewing, it's getting severe 
He wants revenge, that's very clear 

The suitors think they're so cool 
But Antinous is acting like a fool 
They're blinded by their own greed 
While Telemachus waits for his father's lead 

The blow to his dad was a low blow 
Telemachus won't let it go, no-no 
He'll plan his revenge in his own way 
And make the suitors rue that day 

Though silent, teary-eyed he's not 
Telemachus will hit the jackpot 
And make those suitors pay the price 
For their crimes, heavy as cement and ice

Yo, Penelope heard the news, it's true,
That sucka Antinous had hit someone, too.
She turned to her maids and said with a sigh,
"Would that Apollo smite him right in the eye!"

Her girl Eurynome was quick to reply,
"If our prayers were answered, he'd surely die."
Penelope said, "I hate those fools to the core,
But Antinous, that guy I abhor.

"A beggar seeks shelter, asked for a meal,
Each suitor gave, except that jerk for real."
That Antinous, so cruel and vain,
Hit the poor man with a footstool, causing pain.

Penelope's rage burns like a fire,
Hearing this news is her biggest desire,
To see this guy get what's coming his way,
Without Antinous, they'll have a better day.

#JusticeForTheBeggar #AntinousSucks #PenelopeIsQueen

Oh dang, Penelope is on a mission,
She wants to learn about her husband's position.
Ulysses is chillin', getting his grub,
While Penelope wants to find out what's up.

She calls for Eumaeus, the swineherd,
To fetch the stranger, who's got the word.
Maybe he's heard something 'bout her boo,
And can give her some news that's true.

This stranger seems to have been around,
Maybe he's heard a sound.
Penelope's hoping for some insight,
To bring her husband back into her sight.

So, Eumaeus, go and fetch that guy,
Penelope wants to give him a try.
Maybe he's got a story to tell,
And can help bring her husband out of his shell.

Yo, Madam, hold up one sec,
This swineherd's story is far from a wreck!
Odysseus, that's our boy,
Ran from his ship, oh what a ploy!
Eumaeus here had him for days,
Listening to his tale in all sorts of ways.
He claims they've been friends for ages,
And that Minos' descendants took him to different stages.
Our man even said Ulysses is alive,
With heaps of wealth to revive!
So sit back, relax, and let me tell ya,
This story's lit, straight outta Crete, don't ya know? #OdysseusGoals #GreekMythology #LitStory

"Roll up here boy," Penelope retorts,
"I wanna hear his rants and reports.
As for the suitors, let them be,
They can do their thing, they're wild and free.
Drinking up all our fine wine,
Without a care, all feeling just fine.
They keep on partying, day and night,
No one to keep them in sight.
Our resources go to waste,
We have no Ulysses to save our place.
If he and his son came back,
They would give payback, that's a fact."

Yo, Penelope's got a sneeze conspiracy,
Telemachus' sneeze brought good energy,
She wants the stranger to come to the fore,
And promises new threads, what a score!

When the stranger speaks the truth,
Penelope will give him some sick proof,
A shirt and cloak that are all the rage,
It's enough to make any man engage!

And did you catch that sneeze rhyme?
Telemachus' power is sublime,
Penelope knows just what to do,
Her generosity will see her through.

So, let's see if the stranger can pass the test,
And if he can, he'll be dressed with the best,
With Penelope's sneeze theory in effect,
Those pesky suitors will definitely be wrecks!

Oh dang, when Eumaeus heard that plea,
He ran straight to Ulysses with glee.
Yo, Penelope, she's in deep sorrow,
Yearning to see her husband tomorrow.

Oh snap, she wants to hear the truth,
And if she believes you, she'll bring you proof,
A shirt and cloak, so clean and sweet,
Just what you need to get on your feet.

As for bread, don't you even fret,
You can beg in town, no need to fret,
Just ask around and people will give,
And you'll have enough food to always live.

Yo, Penelope, your man's fate is fact,
I know cuz I was partner in his act,
But those suitors, they be straight up cruel,
Their pride and insolence? Like, seriously uncool.

Just now, I was minding my biz,
But some dude gave me a hit, didn't miss,
Telemachus and his crew didn't even come through,
But don't worry, homegirl, I got news for you.

Chill out, be patient, wait till sundown,
Your girl's gonna tell you the truth, no clown,
Just give me a spot by the fire so I can thaw,
My clothes are like paper, not rough and raw.

Then you can ask me about your hubby's return,
I got the info, no need to discern,
Just keep a low profile until it's all clear,
And those suitors get outta here.

Oh snap, Penelope's calling,
Eumaeus, why ain't he stalling?
Why won't he bring the beggar boy in,
Is he afraid he'll face some sin?

Beggars shouldn't be so shy,
Penelope's the bomb, don't lie,
She's cool with anyone coming in,
Even if they're just wearing thin.

Maybe the beggar's got some pride,
And doesn't want to be inside,
Or maybe he's just lost his way,
That's why Eumaeus made him stay.

Either way, Penelope wants to chat,
With the beggar boy, fancy that!
So Eumaeus, step up your game,
And bring him in, no need for shame.

Oh snap, Eumaeus, you're quite the pleaser,
But this stranger's got some skill, he's no teaser.
He's dodging those suitors, like a ninja in the dark,
He just wants to talk to Penelope with his heart.

He's told her to wait till sundown, 
And hey, that's when the best conversations go down.
Madam, trust him, he means no harm,
Just wants to talk and keep you from the harm.

Let's all take a chill pill and relax,
Wait until sundown and counter these attacks.
The stranger's got moves like a ninja or spy,
And he wants to help, so don't be shy.

Oh em gee, Penelope has spoken,
Her words like fire, my heart's now open,
She's sipping tea and telling truths,
While these men act like a bunch of goofs.

She knows these dudes are up to no good,
Their actions just misunderstood,
The man she speaks of is wise indeed,
Their bad intentions, he's going to heed.

These abominable men have no shame,
They act as if it's just a game,
But Penelope knows what's up,
Their schemes are just a sad hiccup.

So let's bow down to this queen's wisdom,
No need for strife or an "ism",
Penelope's got it under control,
Her words leave these men in a black hole.

Ay man, Eumaeus just put Telemachus on blast,
Telling him to keep safe from danger - that's first class.
He's going back to the pigs without a fuss,
To take care of his business, that's a plus.

Telemachus better watch himself for real,
'Cause there's haters lurking, wanting to steal.
But trust, Eumaeus has his back,
Wishing bad luck on those who wanna attack.

Let's hope Jove brings those suckers to a bad end,
Before they can harm our Homeric friend.
But until then, T's gotta stay alert,
Keeping an eye on the situation at this flirt.

Oh snap, Telemachus is stepping up his game,
Telling his guests what to do, that's not lame.
He's got a plan for the day, sacrifices are key,
And with heaven on his side, they're sure to succeed, you see.

It's lit how Telemachus takes charge,
No need for hesitation, no need to barge.
He's got it all under control,
And a sacrifice is the ultimate goal.

So go ahead and eat your dinner,
But don't forget to bring those victims, winner.
Telemachus and heaven will handle the rest,
No need to worry, they'll pass this test.

We stan a king who's got it together,
No need to stress or pull any feathers.
Telemachus is in control,
And his guests are sure to be in awe.

Oh man, did you hear the news?
Eumaeus left the court, no more blues.
He chowed down his dinner and jetted out fast,
Back to his pigs, living life at its last.

The suitors didn't care, they danced and sang,
Having a great time, with no plans to hang.
Singing songs, with their hips swaying side to side,
Dancing so hard, they could not hide their pride.

But little did they know, Odysseus was near,
Planning his return, bringing all the fear.
The suitors' fun would soon come to an end,
And all their laughter and dancing would soon descend.

Yoooo what's up, my dude, let me tell you a tale
It's gonna be lit, I promise not to fail
Picture this: a party with all the greats
Kanye, Beyonce, and even Bill Gates

The bash was popping with music and drinks
Everyone was dancing, no one even blinks
But then, out of nowhere, the lights went out
Everyone was scared, had to scream and shout

Suddenly a voice boomed over the speakers
"Welcome to my party, my lovely geekers!"
It was Elon Musk, looking fly and sleek
His party was gonna be one crazy leak

He showed off his Mars rovers and Tesla cars
Everyone was impressed, no one saw it from afar
But then, Musk revealed his greatest plan yet
He was building a new planet, no more any debts

He wanted to set up a colony with all of us
And then create a civilization with zero fuss
Everyone was stoked and ready to go
But then I woke up and realized it was all just for show

Still, I can't help but dream of what could be
A new planet with all the world's VIPs
Until then, I'll just keep on meme-ing
And imagining a future that's gleaming.

BOOK XVIII

Yo, listen up, this is quite the tale
'Bout a tramp who is known to fail
Named Irus, a man with quite the gut
Who loved to beg and eat, no ifs or buts

He came to Ithaca, running 'round
But Ulysses, he tried to hound
This drunkard's ego just too high
But Ulysses wouldn't let him pry

Irus insults him, tries to get him out
But Ulysses stands strong, no doubt
This tramp's strength was just a show
Ulysses' wit, he didn't know

So the moral of the story here,
Is that even if someone's in the clear
Don't judge a book by its cover, it seems so true
Even this beggar, Irus, can't undo

Bro, you better bounce, 
Or I'll drag you out with ease 
Can't you see them winking at me?
They want you out, it's clear to see 
Get up and leave, don't make me fight 
Or we'll have to start throwing hands tonight 
Peace out, old man, it's time to go 
We don't want no drama, just flow 
Hashtag, sorry not sorry, 
But you gotta hit the curb, in a hurry!

Hold up, Ulysses ain't no hater,
He ain't tryna start no altercation,
He just wants some peace, no drama,
And to avoid any kind of bloody trauma.

He sees you, fellow tramp, and can relate,
He's not jealous, no room for that hate,
Just wants to share the doorway,
And hopes for better luck another day.

But don't go talking about fighting,
Or Ulysses might get to striking,
Old as he is, he's a fighter still,
And won't hesitate to make you chill.

So let's all try to just get along,
No need for beef, no need for a song,
Peace is what we all should seek,
And the gods might bless us with a lucky streak.

Hold up, hold up, what's the deal?
Irus, why you acting so unreal?
Talking like a straight-up hater,
But you don't wanna see anyone greater.

You're sounding like an old boomer,
While we're all hype like a Peppa Pig rumor.
Your insults are weak, your rhymes are offbeat,
We're not gonna give you a seat at our tweet meet.

You wanna fight? Oh, that's so whack,
Your words are just words, but our flow is a fact.
Don't think age matters, don't think we're weak,
We'll take you down, then snap a selfie to keep.

So step up and show us what you got,
But know that we'll never be caught,
Riding on the wave of old-school hate,
We're too busy vibing, too busy being great.

Antinous, you clown
Think you run this town?
Stranger vs. Irus
Looking like it's fight night at the circus
Throwing hands, no need to write a verse
This house is Lit like a fire emoji, can't you see?
Let's cheer them on, yeet yeet, this is the place to be!

Yo, yo, yo! Antinous, you sly fox,
Got a challenge for these homeless bros who've lost their socks.
You see, we got some goat paunches filled with fat and blood,
And whoever wins this fight will feast like a king...bud!

The suitors cheered, and the tramps stepped up to the plate,
Ready to rumble and take on this weighty fate.
With a fierce look in their eyes, they began to fight,
Each one determined to come out on top, and win the night.

The crowd watched in awe as fists were thrown left and right,
And the tramps battled to prove their strength and might.
It was a clash of the titans, a brutal display,
But finally, one man stood victorious at the end of the day.

With a smile on his face, he picked his paunch of choice,
And the suitors cheered, with a loud and joyful voice.
"Welcome to our table, you noble lad," they said,
And the tramp sat down, with a full heart and a happy head.

So remember, dear friends, that even in the darkest of times,
There's a chance to shine, like a star that brightly climbs.
With grit, determination, and a heart full of fire,
You can conquer any challenge, and rise up even higher! #humblebrag #winning #blessed

Ulysses played it sly, acting like a grandpa guy.
But his hunger could not hide, he couldn't stick to his pride.
He said, "My belly's callin', can't stop myself from brawlin'.
But hear me out, my dudes, don't hit me with nasty feuds."

Irus sharpened his punches, ready to cause some bruises.
He smirked and thought, "I got this, Ulysses, be ready for your dis".
But little did he know, Ulysses had some tricks to throw.
He made an oath, a promise that no one would cheat and cause some harmness.

The crowd gathered and cheered, excitement in their eyes, appeared.
Who would win, the young or the old? The story soon to be retold.
Ulysses acted weak, like he had walked miles, strapped on his warrior's shoes, and showed off his wiles.

Irus threw his punches, but his shots were missing.
Ulysses stood his ground and countered with precision.
The old man won the fight, and the crowd went wild with delight.
Irus left with a hurt ego, while Ulysses took home the biggest credo.

It was a fight to behold, a story that will never get old.
Ulysses's wits and tricks had won, proving that age ain't nothin' but a number, son.

Yo, Telemachus spittin' facts and keeping it real,
They ain't messing with his guest, that's the deal.

Antinous and Eurymachus, the chiefs of the crew,
Got their boy's back, they'll fight with him too.

They said an oath, swearin' not to touch a hair,
On the stranger's head, cause otherwise they'll get a scare.

If anyone tries to harm him, then they'll brawl,
Telemachus got his boys locked in, they won't fall.

So, Stranger, don't worry, do you what you need to,
These dudes ain't gonna mess with you, that's true.

They might be fools, but they ain't dumb enough,
To take on Telemachus and his squad, rough and tough.

The scene was set, Ulysses looked fly,
In old rags, but strong enough to touch the sky.
Minerva then came, giving him more might,
The suitors couldn't believe their eyes, it was quite a sight.

One suitor whispered to the other, "Did you even see,
That thigh? Irus is gonna be history."
Ulysses stood tall, broad chest and shoulders too,
The suitors knew they were about to be shown something new.

They were right to be shook, for Ulysses was no joke,
He was about to teach them a lesson that would make them choke.
With Minerva by his side, he took down his foes,
And in that moment, everyone knows, he emerged victorious like a pro.

*meme reference: "I'm not saying I'm Wonder Woman, I'm just saying no one has ever seen me and Wonder Woman in the same room"*

Yo, Irus was shook, feeling quite queasy
As the servants pushed him to face the tramp so seedy
Antinous yelled, calling him a bully in a flash
Saying he should be sent off to king Echetus in a dash

He taunted Irus, dissed him without restraint
Said the tramp was old and Irus was faint
Antinous threatened him with full force
Said he'd pack him off on a ship worse than a cursed course

And if he lost to the old man with ease
He'd send him away for the king to please
Who'd cut off his nose and ears without any care
Draw out his insides for the dogs to share

Irus was so scared he could hardly stand
Thinking he must face this old tramp like a man
Antinous had put him in such a fright
With threats so strong they gave him night fright

Yo, Ulysses, this is quite the scene,
A beggar battle, do you know what I mean?
Irus was scared, but put up his fists,
Ulysses wasn't sure if a hard blow would be missed.

So, they started to fight and Irus got a hit,
But Ulysses fought back and gave him the sh*t.
A neck blow that broke bones made Irus fall down,
The suitors laughed hard, and Ulysses wore the crown.

He dragged the guy to the gate-house,
Told him to stay and not be a louse.
Ulysses was kind but not impressed,
Told Irus to behave or he would be addressed.

"You sad beggar king, hear my advice,
Next time you try to rule, it won't be nice."
So Irus sat against the wall, staff in hand,
And Ulysses left to make another stand. 

#SorryNotSorry #BeggarBattle #PitifulCreature #NoMoreBeggars #OdysseySlayin

Dang, this old geezer's wallet is a mess,
He chucks it back and resumes his throne, I confess,
The suitors giggle and give him a shout,
"May Jove be with you," as they saunter about.

They're grateful for the hobo's interruption,
And offer to escort him to King Echetus without any introduction,
This king's notorious for his murderous ways,
Sending folks six feet under without any delay.

The tramp's future doesn't look too bright,
But at least he put up a good fight,
May we all not end up like 'ol wallet guy,
A beggar on the streets without a dime to ply.

Okay, boomer, don't you worry,
Your life's story won't be so blurry.
Antinous made a paunch filled with fat,
Ulysses knew luck was on his-stat.

Amphinomus handed him two loaves,
And poured some wine, our spirits he troves.
"Good luck to you, father stranger," he cheers,
Hoping for better days, and thus, he jeers. 

Let's sip on this wine, and vibe,
We're all on this journey, don't you hide.
Don't let the bad times take you down,
Stay lit, and wear that crown!

My dude Amphinomus, you seem pretty smart
Your pops is Nisus, I heard he's got heart
Listen up, take heed of what I say
Man's the vainest creature, come what may
As long as he's healthy, man thinks he's fine
Even when Gods bring sorrow divine
I know first hand, used to be super rich
Pride led me to bad deeds, quite the glitch
Gotta fear God and take what heaven gives
Without boasting, that's how a good life lives
These suitors fam, they're causing a scene
Wasting estate, dishonoring the queen
Odysseus is certain to soon return
Don't meet him here, let's take another turn
He's coming, and it won't be pretty
The suitors and he, will not part bloodlessly, it'll be real gritty.

Hold up, let me break this down for y'all,
Amphinomus, he had some bad luck, oh my gosh,
He drank from the gold cup like he didn't care,
But Telemachus was coming and he was aware.

He walked away, bowing his head, full of sorrow,
Little did he know, he wouldn't see tomorrow,
Minerva had a plan, she wanted him gone,
Telemachus was her tool, her pawn.

So Amphinomus took his seat once more,
Unaware that he was in for a war,
But Telemachus had a mission, he had a goal,
And with a swift strike, Amphinomus took a toll. 

It's like they say, you live and you learn,
But in this story, there was no return,
Amphinomus was doomed, his fate was sealed,
Telemachus was the hero, his destiny revealed.

Penelope, the queen so sly,
Changed her plan and gave a try,
To show herself to the suitors, what a play!
But she hated them, that's what she'd say.

She laughed and said to the maid,
"I want to make them more enamoured", she bade.
She wanted to gain more honour without a cause,
And remind her son and husband of the awful flaws.

The suitors' words were fair and neat,
But Penelope knew their plan, their deceit.
She'd like to give her son a sign,
That having anything with them is not fine.

Penelope was smart as a whip,
Her plan would make the suitors flip.
Eurynome was there to assist,
Penelope's new plan couldn't be missed.

"Hey, yo! Listen up, Mom, don't be so blue,
Go wash ya face, get yourself a clue!
Telemachus is now grown, no longer small,
You gotta chill, it's not worth the bawl.

Don't go around with tears in your eyes,
Your son's future is looking pretty fly,
It's time to stop feeling so sad,
Gen-Z is all about feeling rad.

And snap a selfie, with a filter or two,
We gotta make sure your glow is new,
Post it on Insta and show the fam,
That you're still trendy, not just a Mam."

"Oh my God, Penelope my queen, don't you worry,
I won't make you clean, don't worry or hurry,
Your beauty's still real, don't let anyone tell,
Your husband sailed away, but you're still doing swell."

"But girl, let me tell ya, you need your girls by your side,
Autonoe and Hippodamia, they gotta provide
Their support is so key, when you're in the cloister,
Can't let those men see, you gotta be a roister."

"So stay strong, my queen, and don't you feel blue,
Eurynome's got your back, us girls gotta stick like glue,
Through thick and thin, till the very end,
Autonoe and Hippodamia, you need those best friends."

As the old lady left to fetch the maids, Minerva had a plan
To give Penelope a beauty boost that would make all the men
Admire her even more, with grace and charm so fine and fair
Like Venus dancing with the Graces, she made Penelope a sight so rare

Her face was washed with ambrosial loveliness, divine and pure
And her figure was taller, more commanding, strong and sure
Her complexion white as ivory, oh what a stunning view
When Minerva was finished, she left, her work was through

As the maids chattered on, Penelope was in a deep, sweet sleep
Unaware of the goddess's plan, and what she did reap
When she awoke, she would be more beautiful than before
All thanks to Minerva's intervention, and beauty galore!

Oof, girl sounds like she's really in her feels,  
Wishing for death with an emotional appeal,  
But, wait a minute, did she just say "exquisitely delicious sleep"?  
Sounds like she's been binging on some deep web creep!  

She's missing her husband, the top man among Achaeans,  
Makes sense she's feeling all these depressing sensations,  
She wants Diana to end her life all cozy and neat,  
But really, she just needs to get off her feet.  

I mean, come on girl, don't give up the fight,  
Your husband wouldn't want you to go out like a light,  
Instead, go out and slay like Beyoncé,  
You'll see that life's not as gloomy as it seems on a crappy day.  

So, pick yourself up, dust off that despair,  
Get back in the game, and be aware,  
That you're strong, and you can take on anything,  
Just put on a smile and try to sing!

She walked down, her maidens by her,
The suitors were smitten, their hearts a-stir.
She stood by a post, veil in hand,
And each suitor hoped to be her man.

They were so enamored, so desperately in love,
For her beauty, they prayed to the stars above.
Each one wanted her to be his bed fellow,
But her heart was true to a far-off beau.

Her charm was like a viral meme,
And they all wanted to be part of her team.
The suitors were tweeting, expressing their feels,
But they didn't know she had other ideals.

Her maidens stood beside her, ever so loyal,
As she stood there, calm and royal.
Her beauty was like a Snapchat filter,
And they all wanted to be with her.

But the lady was smart, she knew what to do,
She had plans of her own, and they didn't have a clue.
So she kept them at bay, and played it cool,
And they were left drooling like fools.

"Yo, Telemachus my dude," said she, "I'm noticing a bit of an attitude. You used to be super smooth like a Cadillac; what happened to your gratitude? Now that you're older and looking hella fine, your behavior ain't so divine. That commotion earlier was straight up scandalous, and why'd you let that stranger get handled so vicious? What if that dude got seriously hurt in our crib, that would've been super cringe and not a good look, fib."
