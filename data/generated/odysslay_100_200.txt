"OK, OK, OK!" I exclaimed, "This plan is fire!
Telemachus, go with Nestor, let him be your sire.
Minerva, you go back, to give those sailors some cheer,
Young bucks on a quest, nothing they’ll fear.

"There's money to be had, the Cauconians owe you some cash,
Get your coin girl, build up your stash.
Nestor, you the OG, take Telemachus under your wing,
Get him a dope ride and make that boy sing.

"Best horses for Telemachus, let him flex his speed,
This journey will be one gnarly deed.
I'm hyped to see how this will all unfold,
Let's see what fire and adventure will be unrolled!"

Oh my goodness, did you hear?
Telemachus got a visit so dear
From the Trito-born queen of the skies
Who flew away in eagle disguise

Nestor was shook, and took his hand
Said, "You'll be a hero in this land
The gods must be watching over you
To have such favour, that's so true"

He asked for the queen's grace to come down
On him, his wife, and kids all around
And as an offering, he would be so bold
To give a heifer with horns of gold

Wow, Nestor knows how to make a deal
And he's got a great offering to reveal
Let's hope the queen accepts it with grace
And showers them with blessings and a smiling, emoji-filled face

Yo, Telemachus was in the town,
And his fam were gettin' down.
Nestor's place was where they stayed,
And sweet wine was the drink they made.

This wine was from eleven years past,
But Nestor poured it fast.
He prayed to Athena up above,
For grace and peace and lots of love.

When they finished drinks to the hilt,
They all laid down and soon grew still.
Telemachus, son of dear Odysseus,
Slept with Pisistratus, Nestor's precious.

Nestor and his wifey boo,
Slept in their room, cozy and true. 
Minerva was watchin', we can bet,
Makin' sure they slept safe and sound, you betcha.

Yo, it's a new day dawning, and Nestor's swarming
Around his crib made of marble that's shining,
His papa, Neleus, used to sit on these thrones,
But now he uses Hades as his new home.
Nestor's sceptre's ready to rule the land,
His five sons by his side, making a strong band,
Telemachus now also chilling with them,
Joining Nestor and his squad of mighty men.
And here's the tea, Nestor's about to speak,
Pouring out his thoughts, staying on the beat.
So, let's sit back, catch up with the act,
And see what Nestor has to say, that's a fact.

Alright, my dudes, listen up and hear me now,
Pop quiz: which Greek god is said to be endowed?
The one, the only, goddess so serene,
The wise Athena, who should be first seen.

So, let's get this party started with some haste,
Pick up the phone, call the stockman with some grace,
Tell him to find a heifer so divine,
Quickly hurry, don't waste any more time!

And to Telemachus's ship we go,
Invite the crew, make sure they all know,
Leave two behind to watch the ship with care,
Off to the feast, let's all beware!

Ooh, and don't forget the goldsmith, you guys,
Grab Laerceus, and don't be slow to rise,
We need to gild those horns up real bright,
Make sure they shine so we can sleep through the night.

To the maids in the house, we'll give a shout,
Cook us up something good, that's what it's all about,
Fetch us some wood, some seats and some water clear,
We're going to praise Athena, let's make that clear.

So there you have it, my peeps, that's the plan,
Let's execute it well, like only Greeks can.
And if you do just as I say,
Trust me, your wild rave reviews will make my day!

Okay, let me tell you 'bout what went down,
Nestor's crew was running all over town.
They brought in a heifer, pretty and fine,
Telemachus's crew joined in just in time.

The goldsmith came with his trusty tools,
Anvil, hammer, tongs, he ain't no fool.
And even our girl Minerva was there,
Ready for the sacrifice, without a care.

Nestor handed out the gold like it ain't no thing,
And the smith gilded the horns so they would bling.
Then Stratius and Echephron grabbed her by the head,
While Aretus brought in water with a flower pattern instead.

Thrasmyedes stood by with his axe so sharp,
And Perseus held a bucket without a harp.
Nestor cleansed his hands and said a prayer,
As he threw a lock of hair into the fire with care.

Yo, the story of Nestor and the heifer is wild,
The daughters and daughters-in-law were hype and smiled,
They watched Thrasymedes cut through the cattle's neck,
And the women screamed with glee, that's what I call a flex.

Pisistratus sliced the throat, the heifer was dead,
Cutting it up, they had meat and bones to shred,
They put some raw meat on the thigh bones for flavor,
And Nestor poured wine, yo, they had mad flavor.

The young men held five-pronged spits in their hands,
And toasted the meat over fire, what do you understand?
It's all about the taste, the culture and the feast,
Nestor and his family, they definitely had a beast.

With inward meats tasted, the feast was almost done,
They cut up the rest of the meat, that's how it's done,
Popped it on the spits and toasted it to perfection,
Nestor and his fam, that's a great tradition.

Polycaste, Nestor's daughter, gave Telemachus a wash,
Anointed him with oil, made him look like a boss.
She gave him a shirt and a mantle that were fair,
He sat by Nestor, feeling without a care.

They drew off the meats, sat down to dinner,
Waited upon by henchmen, like worthy winners.
Golden cups of wine were poured out with glee,
Nestor spoke up, his voice loud and free.

"Sons, put Telemachus's horses to the chariot,
Let him start at once, it's time to hurry, it's time to jet."
Telemachus got up, ready for the next phase,
He was off to find his dad, the voyage began with a blaze.

Telemachus, man about town,
Got in the chariot, rode around.
Pisistratus, decked out and fly,
Sat beside him with a sigh.

The horses yoked and ready to go,
Off they flew with a mighty glow.
They left Pylos behind, oh so grand,
Their chariot flew across the land.

All day they swayed with a mighty force,
Their journey taking them far off course.
They passed the night at Diocles' place,
With sweet hospitality kissing their face.

Come morning, they again took the lead,
Out through the gateway, picking up speed.
They came to the corn fields, high and tall,
Their horses taking them through it all.

Finally, their journey came to an end,
Their journey did bend and curve and wend.
But thanks to their mighty steeds so fleet,
They had triumphed over many a feat.

The scene was set for something grand.
I heard a story that was totally fire,
It had me hooked, my heart was a desired.

The teller started with "Hey fam, hear this,"
And I was ready for a tale of bliss.
She said, "Once upon a time in a land far away,
A story of courage and love that'll make your day."

I said "Tell me more sis, what can I expect?"
She replied "Picture it, a meme-worthy effect!
A protagonist that's cooler than ice,
a plot that's spicy, with no need for spice."

I was getting excited, I couldn't pretend,
The epic story that was about to transcend.
And as she went on with her narrative,
I knew that the ending was gonna be lit.

So now, whenever I think of that night,
I always look back with pure delight.
That story was something that'll stay with me,
And in my heart, it'll always be free.

Yo, what's up my squad, let me tell you a story that's not a fraud.
It's about a dude who thought he was slick, but ended up looking like he got hit with a brick.

He slid into her DMs, thinking he could win her heart,
But little did he know, his smooth moves would fall apart.

He hit her with the classic "wyd",
But she wasn't impressed, she just hit back with an "lol why?"

He thought he'd try a pick-up line,
But she shut him down with a simple decline.

He started to panic, his ego taking a hit,
He didn't know what to do with himself, not one little bit.

He thought memes were the key to her heart,
But his jokes fell flat, they didn't even start.

In the end, he had to face the music,
His attempts to woo her were just plain stupid.

So let this be a lesson to all my internet crew,
Slide into DMs at your own risk, you might end up feeling blue.

BOOK IV

As they approached Lacedaemon, a city so stout,
They drove straight to Menelaus, with no doubt.
He was in his own house, feasting and all,
Honoring the wedding of his son and daughter, having a ball.

The daughter was getting wed to Achilles' son,
Their love story being told for years, it was done.
He had made a promise while fighting in Troy,
And now, the gods were making it a joy.

He was sending her with horses and chariots,
To the city of Myrmidons, all hailing it.
For his only son, he had found a bride,
This blessing brought happiness, nowhere to hide.

Born to him of a bondwoman, Megapenthes was his name,
From heavens, no more children to Helen, it was a shame.
Although Hermione, fair as golden Venus herself,
Was with them, their love was never on the shelf.

Yo, the party at Menelaus' is lit,
His neighbours and kinsmen are all legit.
Blasting tunes and rhymes with the bard on the lyre,
While the tumblers flip and perform higher.

The man's tune was fire, you gotta know,
Like Drake dropping his latest flow.
The crowd's energy was off the chain,
No one could resist the urge to maintain.

As the night went on, they laughed and cheered,
A glimpse of the good life, they all revered.
The memes and slangs were flying around,
Everyone at the party was internet-bound.

And that's how the party went down,
A true display of culture that astounds.
Menelaus' crib was the place to be,
A night to remember for eternity.

Oh my gosh, Menelaus, please listen up quick,
Strangers at the gate, are they here for a trick?
They look like demigods, sons of Jove, I swear,
Shall we take their horses out, or leave them with care?

Do we let them in, or show them to the door?
Maybe they came only to even the score,
We shouldn't judge a book by its cover,
Maybe they're lost, looking for their mother.

Let's give them a chance, and offer hospitality,
A few drinks and food will show our nobility,
Who knows, they could be friends forever,
Or we could bond over our love for Trevor. (Noah Centineo?)

So Eteoneus, let's welcome them in,
Hoping that our new friendship will begin,
And if they don't turn out as we would expect,
We'll handle the situation with mutual respect.

Yo, Eteoneus, don't act like a clown,
Take their horses out of town.
Invite them in and give them grub,
We've stayed at other peeps' house, no need to snub.

Menelaus ain't happy, he's super mad,
But we gotta be good hosts, ain't that rad?
We'll show them some hospitality,
And maybe they'll bring some vitality.

Let's hope we can rest now, without strife,
And live our best life, drama-free life.
But first, we gotta take care of these guests,
And treat them like kings, better than the rest.

Eteoneus told his homies to come fast,
They took off the yoke and gave the horses a repast.
They chowed down on oats and barley mixed,
And then into the house they quickly fixed.

Telemachus and Pisistratus were both shook,
The house was luxurious, like a celebrity's look.
It shone like the sun and moon so bright,
They couldn't believe it was all in sight.

After the house tour, they went to the bath,
Washing off the dirt and taking a deep laugh.
Like a spa day but just for the fellas,
Relaxing after their journey to dwellas.

So Menelaus was chillin' with his homies,
when they pulled up lookin' sharp and not so lonely.
The servants got them lookin' fresh and clean,
Dripping in oil like a queen supreme.

The maidservant came through with the golden ewer,
pouring water so fresh you'd swear it's pure,
into a silver basin by their hand,
Cleansing their mitts like it's part of the plan.

The upper servant blessed them with some bread,
And laid out a feast for them well-fed.
With plates of meat and cups of gold,
These guys were set to have stories told.

Yo, Menelaus was all like "Fall to, don't be shy,
When you're done with your supper, I gotta ask why,
Who you are and where you from, I gotta pry,
Such noble heritage, can't be denied."

Menelaus peeped their lineage, he was keen,
Said only kings could have sons so pristine,
No way they came from poverty, that's obscene,
Their royal bloodline was clearly seen.

I bet these men were sipping on that tea,
Living their best lives, happy as can be,
They were definitely woke, we can all agree,
Menelaus knew they weren't no bourgeoisie.

Oh my, Telemachus is spittin' heat,
Check out that juicy meat they're about to eat.
Feast your eyes on all that bronze and gold,
It's like seeing the palace of the gods, so bold.

Telemachus whispers in Pisistratus' ear,
He wants no one else to overhear.
"Damn, bro, this place is so lit!
I can't even handle it, not one bit."

The shine of amber, ivory, and silver,
Is enough to make us all quiver.
Telemachus is feeling pure admiration,
This palace is the ultimate destination.

I can't help but feel the same way too,
This palace is making me feel brand new.
Let's eat that roast loin with all our might,
And party like it's the end of the night.

Listen up, my peeps, this a tale to tell,
Menelaus got a story, let's listen well.
Jove's immortal, and his riches never-ending
But mortal men's wealth may be equal or bending.
For years on end he travelled the world,
Went to Cyprus, Phoenicia, the bags were twirled.
Went to Ethiopia, the Sidonians and the Erembians too,
And to Libya where the lambs are born with horns, oh who knew?
The milk, cheese and meat were in abundance there,
Enough to satisfy the stomachs anywhere.
But while he was gone, his brother was slain,
By his wife's wickedness, causing him so much pain.
His mansion and riches don't please him anymore,
He wishes he had less wealth, lost in Troy's war.
The loss that made him grieve the most,
Was a man who risked it all, the great Achaean host.
He risked his life, but gained not a thing,
It's unknown if he's alive or if death's sting
Has taken him away, leaving his family to sorrow,
His son, wife, and father with their hearts in the burrow.

Yo, Menelaus spoke truth,
And Telemachus, he felt it too,
His heart yearned for his father's return,
Tears pouring out like a river churned.
Menelaus wondered what was the deal,
Should he ask at once or let him feel?
To speak his truth when ready, or to force it out,
Like when you're hangry and ready to shout.

Oh dang, Helen came down from her room, looking fine as a glow-up on zoom. Adraste brought a seat, Alcippe a soft rug, it was all so comfy like a warm hug. Phylo brought a silver work-box - oh my gosh, that's lit! Alcandra's gift was a hit! Polybus was a boss, yo! From Egyptian Thebes, where the gold doth flow. He gave Menelaus two baths of pure silver, not too shabby for a wealthy giver. Ten talents of gold were in the mix, his generosity gave everyone a fix. And Helen, boo - she got the real treat, a gold distaff and a silver box on wheels, so neat. Phylo placed it beside her, with yarn and wool, Helen settled in, looking cool. She put her feet up, started to chat, "Hey Menelaus, where you been at?"

Yo, Menelaus, I must confess
These strangers got me quite impressed
Do we know their names, can we guess?
I swear, one of them's like Telemachus, no stress!

This young man's features are so alike
It's hard for me to even spike
What I think and feel inside - it's trike!
Like they're both dolls from the same Levike!

Ulysses left Telemachus while he was a tot
It was a sad event that left us in knots
Now these strangers here, in our ports
Might be the ones we've missed, our thoughts.

You know what they say, it's a small world
Even with our hair curled and twirled
People can look alike and be swirled
Into an adventure, a story unfurled!

I can't wait to see what happens next
Will they surpass some tricky text?
We'll see if they're heroes or suspects,
And if their journey leads to some big connects!

Okay, hold up, hold up, let me tell you 'bout a story,
Of Menelaus, his homie, and his wife all in glory.
They saw a dude who looked like Ulysses by his side,
With the same hair and feet, they couldn't decide.

Menelaus talked about Ulysses, and then,
This mysterious guy cries, like, tears and shiz, amen?
He hid his face 'cause he was feelin' all the pain,
Of Ulysses and the suffering he sustained.

It's crazy how one man's journey can touch so many,
Even strangers cryin' for him, I can't believe any.
Ulysses must be one heck of a dude,
To make grown men weep, feelings all renewed.

Yo, Menelaus, I gotta say
Your instincts are on fleek today
This young man's name is Telemachus, it's true
But he's too humble to speak with you

My pops, Nestor, sent me to guide
Telemachus here, to get inside 
Your mind divine and pick your brain
For advice that might ease his pain

You know how it is, home's a wreck
When Dad's not there to jump in the mix
Telemachus needs a hand to hold
Cause no one supports him, it's getting old

Menelaus, you're talking about Telemachus, the son of your friend,
The one who's with me now, and on this mission to tend.
You had hoped to host him with distinction, give him the best,
Founding a city for him, and building a house with zest.

You would have made him leave Ithaca, with goods and clan,
And sacked a neighbouring city, just because you can.
You'd have seen each other often, and real tight,
Nothing but death could have interrupted your insight.

But alas, heaven had other plans, it seems,
Stopping Telemachus' father's dreams.
But now here he stands, in front of you today,
Ready to chase off the suitors and slay.

So let's get to work and stop this wooing mess,
And make sure Telemachus has victory, nothing less.
We'll show those suitors who's really in charge,
And send them running, just like a viral meme, it's large.

Bro, your words hit me hard,  
Got me crying, feeling like a bard.  
Helen, Telemachus, all of us in tears,  
Even Pisistratus, holding back his fears.  

Antilochus, man, he was real,  
Lost his life in battle, Achilles' steel.  
Bright Dawn took him away,  
Now he's gone, forever to stay.  

Menelaus, your grief is heard,  
We'll all remember Antilochus' word.  
The battles he fought, the courage he showed,  
Antilochus' memory will forever glow.  

In his honor, let's raise a glass,  
Cheers to our brother, who's now in the past.  
May he rest in peace, forevermore,  
Antilochus, we will always adore.  

*cries in Gen-Z*

Yo, listen up, my dear old sir,
Your understanding's rare, that's for sure.
If it's possible, do as I urge,
No time for tears, let's get to the dessert.
Morning will come, the sun will rise,
In the forenoon, we'll mourn all those goodbyes.
All we can do is shave our heads,
And let out all our tears in threads.
A brother of mine died in Troy,
Name's Antilochus, oh boy.
He was quite a champ in his own right,
Fighting enemies with all his might.
But now he's gone, we can't see his face,
All we can do is mourn and embrace.

Aye, Menelaus, you spittin' the truth with finesse,
Discretion, my guy, you got it on fleek, no stress.
You talkin' 'bout Nestor, that's a boss man,
He blessed with a wifey and dope offspring all grand.

Let's stop this weeping and bury it deep,
Let's eat our grub and not stay up too late to sleep.
Pour water on our hands and cleanse our souls,
And chow down on some food that's filling our bowls.

Telemachus and I'll have a chat tomorrow,
No worries, we're homies, no need to feel sorrow.
We'll catch up on life and spill all the tea,
But right now, let's focus on food and be carefree.

Yo, let me tell you 'bout Asphalion,
Where they pour water and get their hands on,
All the tasty goods in front,
Serving up meals that you'll want to flaunt.

They wash their hands like a boss,
'Cause hygiene doesn't have a loss,
Then they feast on that prime cuisine,
Tasting flavors like they've never seen.

Asphalion's got it all down,
No need to wear a fancy crown,
Just chill and enjoy the spread,
Like a cool meme that's been well-said.

Helen was feeling pretty clever,
So she spiked the wine with a special lever,
An herb that banished all your sorrows,
A perfect cure for all your morrows.
No tears would fall from anyone's eyes,
Not even if their family dies.
This potent power was given by Polydamna,
Wife of Thon, from Egypt, where they grow some dank flora.
Paeeon's descendants are all skilled in the art of healing,
That's just common knowledge, there's no need for feeling. 
Helen then instructed the servants to serve the wine,
And everything seemed to be going just fine.

Hey y'all, it's story time
Listen while I tell you a tale so fine
About Ulysses and his sneaky little trick
Took Troy down with his disguise so slick

He wore rags and got all bruised
Into the enemy's city he cruised
No one recognized him, what a sly fox
Except for Helen's boy, who called him out of the box

But Ulysses was too smart for that
He didn't give in to the skilled diplomat
After he was washed, dressed and sworn to secrecy 
He spilled all the tea on Trojan activity

He killed a lot of them, got important intel too
And the Trojan women wailed, "Boo-hoo"
But for Menelaus, it was all Gucci
He was happy to hear all of Ulysses' newsy

Venus took Althaea's husband away
But this story ain't about that betrayal
It's about Trojan demise with Ulysses at play
So let's give it up for his disguise portrayal

Menelaus, my man, I totally agree,
Ulysses is the one king that reigns supreme,
He showed bravery and endurance ahoy,
In the wooden horse, he played coy.
And then, oh snap, you came talkin' smack,
Deiphobus by your side with the attack.
You pat our hiding place, made a fuss,
Called out our chiefs one by one, oh shush!
But Ulysses, bruh, he held us all firm,
Stopped Anticlus from getting outta turn,
Thank God for that, or we would be toast,
Saved by our boy, our ultimate host.

Yo, Telemachus is shook, oh my gosh! 
All his efforts? Total wash, oh my posh!
His courage, strong as iron in the fray,
But victory escaped him anyway. 

Now let's just hit the hay and catch some Z's,
So we wake up refreshed with no bad fleas.
Let's all lie down and get some sleep,
And tomorrow, y'all know we'll continue to reap.

Yo, listen up, let me tell you a tale,
Of Telemachus, son of Odysseus the male.
He went on a journey with Pisistratus by his side,
To find his dad and restore his family's pride.

They stopped at the gates of a mansion so grand,
And came across the queen of beauty, Helen so tanned.
She ordered her maids to make beds with red rugs,
And woollen cloaks too, for the guests to hug.

So the maids went out, carrying a torch,
And made the beds, as if it were their porch.
Telemachus and Pisistratus slept outside,
While Atreus' son had Helen as his guide.

In the forecourt, they dozed off to sleep,
While Atreus' son had dreams, oh so deep.
Helen by his side, he felt so serene,
A beauty queen like her, could never be a has been.

Yo, what's up, my dude, let's chat and chill,
I woke up feeling fly, like ready to kill,
I look like a god, my style's so clean,
I'm Menelaus, the hottest king you've seen.

But let's get down to business, no time to waste,
I need to know, what brings you to this place?
You've got the looks, the attitude, the swag,
But why leave your crib, why cramp your dad's rag?

I know you're searching for your daddy-O,
And I respect that, it's a gnarly go,
But here's the tea, you're in a messy fix,
With suitors after you, trying to mix.

They wanna marry your mom, take her cash,
And you're the obstacle, the only clash,
So we gotta scheme, gotta be sly,
And make them think, you'll never say bye.

We'll show them what's up, we'll make them see,
That you'll reclaim your throne, be wild and free,
With me by your side, your wingman for life,
We'll make Homer's Odyssey, come to life.

Oh dang, hold up, who knew 
Telemachus was taking a trip to Lacedaemon, too?
Is it for the government or for his own thing?
Come on, spill the tea, let's hear that ring-a-ding-ding! 

I know it's been a long time since we last spoke,
But don't be shy, dude, let's get this convo woke.
What's the story, what's the 411?
I wanna know everything, every detail, every run-on.

Is he doing it for the 'gram, a new adventure to explore?
Or maybe he's going undercover, like a secret agent for sure.
Either way, tell me all about it, no need to be coy.
I'm all ears, dude, spill the tea with joy!

Yo, Telemachus, no need to be shy,
I'm down to help you, so just tell me why
You're here standing in front of me, 
What's up with your family?

You say your crib's being eaten alive,
And your pops is MIA, no longer alive,
You wanna know how he died, 
Whether he drowned or was fried?

No need to hold back for my sake,
I'll tell you straight up, make no mistake
If your dad helped me back in the day,
I'd be happy to repay.

I'll tell you what I know, 
No need for you to put on a show,
Whether I saw it or heard it,
My words won't be a bit legit.

But your dad, he was a man to never rest,
He was brave, adventurous, and one of the best,
He got caught up in some trouble,
And the whole situation turned into rubble.

But I won't sugar-coat or hide the truth,
Your dad met his end, that's the proof,
He fought valiantly 'til the very end,
But the journey was too hard to extend.

Now don't you worry, don't you fret,
Your dad's legacy will never ever forget,
He will be remembered for ages and ages,
And your quest will surely turn many pages. 

Keep your head up, things will turn out fine,
Stay strong like your dad, and you'll do just fine,
Remember, life's a journey, it's not the end,
And with that, my young friend, we shall ascend.

Yo, Menelaus was so shocked,
He couldn't believe what he had clocked.
These cowards want to take the bed,
Like, bro, are they out of their heads?

It's like a hind leaving her young,
In a lion's den, which is mad dumb.
When the lion comes back, it's all over,
Just like how Ulysses will end these lovers.

By Jove, Minerva, and Apollo,
If Ulysses fights like he did in Lesbos, oh boyo,
These suitors won't get a chance to say "I do",
They'll be gone, like a meme that's already through.

About the old man of the sea, no lie,
Menelaus won't try to deceive or deny,
He'll spill the tea, spill it fast,
Like how VSCO girls spill their Hydro Flasks.

Yo, this Grecian man's tale is quite the jam,
He was stuck in Egypt, hatching a plan.
His big thanksgiving feast wasn't enough,
The gods were mad, they needed more stuff.

He had to sail away to an island called Pharos,
They had a good harbor, enough for his cause.
But the gods weren't pleased, they becalmed his ship,
Twenty whole days, no fair wind, such a drip.

His crew was hungry, they needed a meal,
They would've starved if not for Idothea's deal.
She was Proteus's daughter, a real savior,
She helped him out, with a move of godly favor. 

Thanks to her, this hero lives to tell,
Of how a goddess saved him so well. 
This story's lit, it's something to tweet,
It's got everything, even the kitchen sink.

Oh man, this story's about to get real profound
The speaker's feeling lost, no direction can be found
A lady approaches him, with words sharp as a knife,
Saying he's comfortable starving, with no energy or life.

But wait, where's that sound coming from?
It's the island, and everyone's fishing, one by one.
The men cast their barbed hooks, hoping to get a catch,
But nothing can be found, no food for anyone to match.

The lady urges the speaker, to escape this misery,
To save his men and leave this island, that's no longer free.
Her insights are crushing, her tone so sincere,
She's like a wise friend, that's always near.

So will he take her advice and leave this land?
Or stay in his comfort zone, with no helping hand?
The story's still there, and we'll never know,
But the lesson's quite clear, an opportunity in life, don't let it go!

Yo, let me spill the tea,
I'm not staying here, can't you see?
I think I angered the gods,
Living life against the odds.
Which goddess is causing me strife?
And how do I escape this life?
The gods know all, that's no lie,
Can't you help a homie out and reply?
Cause seriously, I gotta go,
Snapchat awaits, you know how it goes.

Yo, listen up, I'll make this clear,
About a guy you really ought to fear,
Proteus, an old immortal, lives in the sea,
An Egyptian legend, a mystery to thee.

He's Neptune's head man, with knowledge profound,
To catch him tight, in the depths you must be bound,
He'll help you with your voyage, make you wise,
And guide you on the path to reach the skies.

He'll spill the tea, if you dare to ask,
About your home, your family, your task,
All the deets, good and bad, he'll share,
And you'll be ready to face the truth, if you dare. 

So gear up now, and catch him soon,
With Proteus on your side, you'll be over the moon,
He knows the seas like the back of his hand,
And with his help, you'll soon make land. 

Now go, go, go, and don't you stop,
Until you snare that old immortal and make him pop,
Use all the tricks in the book, don't be shy,
And soon you'll be sailing high like a butterfly! #ProteusPower

Oh, snap! That's a tough one, man,
But I'm the hype assistant - I'm your biggest fan!
To catch a god like that, you'll need a sly plan,
Something sneaky, crafty, and totally off-brand.

Let me help you out, listen up, bro,
We need a disguise, something no one will know,
We'll blend in with the gods, from head to toe,
And catch this old timer before he says "woah!"

So, let's grab some wings and put on our best fit,
A Hermes staff too, we can't forget this bit!
We'll fly around fast as Twitter trends shift,
And catch that god before he knows we exist!

Now, let's add a filter, adjust the hue,
And post it all on Insta, for the world to view,
We'll show off our catch, like it's something new,
And everyone will think we're the coolest crew.

"Listen up, homie, let me make this clear,
When the sun hits its peak, you gotta gear up, no fear.
The man of the sea rises, the West wind making waves,
He snoozes in his cave, where the seals are his faves.

Halosydne's chickens, that's what they're called,
They smell like fish, and they're quite enthralled.
Tomorrow, I'll show you where to hide,
And all the tricks of the trade, I'll confide.

Gather your three best dudes, this is no drill,
We'll be like the Avengers, taking down the old man's skill.
So, be ready to pounce, be quick on your toes,
And we'll make sure that old man knows who's boss."

Yo, listen up quick, this ain't no trick,
The seals are the key, to catch this big freak.
He counts 'em up, on his five fingers, no cap,
Then he sleeps, among them, like a shepherd taking a nap.

When he dozes off, that's when you make the move,
Hold him tight, don't let him groove.
He'll try to escape, turning into fire and water,
But grip him stronger, like holding on to a quarter.

Once he talks to you, let the grip go light,
Question away, get your journey right.
Find out which god is mad, and why,
Then homeward bound, let out a sigh.

This ain't no myth, it's a classic tale,
Like that old-school meme, "epic fail".

Yo, so she jumped in the sea,
And I turned back to where my ships be.
My heart was heavy with care,
As I walked back with the cool night air.

Back at my ship, we cooked up some chow,
Camped on the beach, night was here now.
My mind was still on the ocean's mystery,
But my crew was chillin', not feelin' the history.

Yo, when the sun's pink fingers rose in sight,
I took three guys who were down to fight,
We trudged along the coast with all our might 
While I prayed to heaven with all my bite.

Hermes gave the lowdown, just before dawn
And told me we'd need to keep our heads on.

Then she brought me four seal skins to use 
Making sure we had no excuse. 
And since we had a rancid smell,
Ambrosia to our noses the goddess fell.

We each lay in a pit, covered in fur,
As we waited for the giant to slur. 
The stinky seals were driving us mad 
Thankfully, with ambrosia, we were glad!

Hey, listen up, let me tell you a tale
Of some guys who went and set a trap, no fail
They spent the morning watching seals sunbath
Until the old man showed up, on his path

He counted his seals, thought he was slick
Little did he know, he was about to get a nasty trick
With a shout, they seized him and he transformed, quick
Into a lion, dragon, wild boar, a tree, so sick

But they held on tight, didn't give up the chase
Until the old man broke down, couldn't keep up the pace
He asked what they wanted, started to plead his case
But they held steady, wouldn't give up, not even a space

He asked which god helped them hatch the plan
But they just laughed, they didn't give a damn
They wanted revenge, something they had to demand
And this old man, he couldn't even withstand

So let this be a lesson to all the trappers out there
If you're gonna set a trap, be sure to beware
The one who you catch might not be so rare
But someone who can transform on a dare. YOLO!

Dude, the struggle is real, man oh man
Stuck on this island, feeling like a castaway, I swear I can
No way to escape, my spirit's low, feeling quite blue
Oh wise one, tell me: which god is giving me the screw?
Moreover, guide my sails, tell me the way
So I can get the heck out of here and make it home someday.

Yo, listen up, sailor of the sea
If you wanna be with your homies, happy and free
You gotta make some sacrifices, it's the key
To please Jove and other gods, it's their decree

Before embarking, heed this advice
Offer holy hecatombs, and be precise
Only then you'll be in good favor and suffice
And finally return to Egypt to reunite with your tribe

The gods are mighty and don't take it lightly
So make sure you get it right and don't act slightly
If you want to finish your voyage brightly
And finally see your home and family tightly

In this world of legend and myth
It's important to keep the gods happy and with
Their blessings, you'll be able to smoothly lift
Yourself and your crew and finally shift

So, remember to make your offerings, it's a must
And the gods will be kind, that's a trust
In the end, you'll be happily reunited and adjust
With your own house, like the boomers' Frozen's Elsa, just.

Oh dang, my heart was shattered into two
When I heard I had to go to Egypt anew
But I sucked it up, said "alright, bet"
And asked if our folks all made it out yet

Did every single Achaean bro
Make it back home, all good to go?
Or did someone face an untimely fate
On their ship or with friends, too little too late?

'Oh snap, 'Son of Atreus,' he replied, 'are you sure you want to know how it goes down? Brace yourself, cuz my story is lit and it flows. Many of the bros you're asking for are no longer alive, but some made it back and are thriving. Only two of the top-notch leaders, who went with you, met their fate on the way home. As for that battle scene, you were there too, it was crazy, you know what I mean. This third Achaean leader is still chilling at sea, he's alive and well, but the sea's got him stuck. Ajax got damaged and Neptune sent him to the rocks of Gyrae; but Neptune spared his life and he could've made it, but then he started boasting and ruined it. He said he was un-drownable even for the gods to kill, so Neptune got mad and grabbed his trident to give a thrill. Neptune split the rock where Ajax was sitting and the sea swallowed him whole, and that was it.  So that bro, drank salt water and didn't make it.'

Yo, let me tell you about this G named Agamemnon  
He was on a voyage, with his bro and a ton  
And just when he thought he was out of the wind  
It picked up and took him for a spin  

Juno wasn't having it, she came through clutch  
Protected his brother, kept him out of a rut  
But then the wind got crazy and things got dicey  
They ended up at Thyeste's house, oh so pricey  

But the gods weren't done, they had one last trick  
They backed up the wind, made it nice and slick  
Our boy Agamemnon was finally home  
And he couldn't help but cry, tears start to foam  

He kissed the ground, so happy to be back  
All the gods had his back, that's a fact  
Agamemnon's story is a wild ride  
But he made it back safe, with the gods on his side.

"Hey, did y'all hear about this epic tale,
When Aegisthus plotted to make Agamemnon fail?
He promised his watchman two talents of gold,
To make sure that Agamemnon wouldn't be bold.
But when he saw him pass, he gave the green light,
And plotted his betrayal with all his might.
Ambushed with twenty of his bravest men,
Agamemnon fell for Aegisthus' evil plan.
He threw a grand feast which was all a facade,
For Agamemnon was caught in a death trap facade.
Foul play was Aegisthus' way of the day,
He butchered Agamemnon without any delay.
Not a follower alive, nor a soul left standing,
The cloisters were left with carnage so demanding." 👀

Yo Proteus spittin truth, made me feel it in my youth.
My heart's now shattered, my mind's scattered.
I sat on the sand, tears in my hand.
I didn't wanna see light, things weren't looking bright.
Old man of the sea said "Boy, stop cryin'; it's just useless whinin'."
Atreus' son, get up and run, cause Aegisthus is still havin' fun.
Orestes was quick, but you can still carry the stick.
Come back home, don't you roam, it's time for the funereal dome.

Oh my gosh, you wanna know about the third dude,
Was he lost at sea or just feeling blue? 
Tell me the truth, it won't make me rude,
Even if it's sad and makes me boo-hoo.

I'm here for you and all your sorrow,
Let's chat about it, don't need to borrow.
Is he out at sea, not knowing what to do?
Or has he left this world, to start anew?

Spill the tea, don't keep me waiting,
Let's talk about it, no hesitating.
I promise to be here, like a good pal,
So let's dig deep and reveal the tale.

But before that, let me reference a meme,
So we can make this story, like a fun dream.
"Tell me more about this man, please and thanks,"
As we unravel the details, like a bunch of pranks.

'The tea is hot, my dude,' cried I, showing off my attitude. 
Calypso got Ulysses, though, trapped on her island. 
His heart's filled with sorrow, feeling solo and stranded. 
He's got no transport or sailor crew to get him to his house. 
But for Menelaus, death is averted, and it's no rouse. 
Instead, gods will take him to Elysian plains. 
Rhadamanthus is king, and life there is far from mundane. 
In Elysium, never snow nor hail nor rain does fall. 
The West wind from Oceanus gives energy to all. 
All of this is coming because of Helen, his wife. 
Being Jove's son-in-law brings on this five-star afterlife.'

Yo, Odyssey, my bro!
This story's 'bout to blow!
He dived under the waves,
And left me to be brave.

I felt so much despair,
As I went with my whole squad,
Towards the ships, we had to prepare
To leave where we had trod.

When dawn broke, we were ready,
Our sails and masts were set steady.
We hit the sea with our oars,
And rowed towards the land of the bores.

I stopped by the stream of Egypt,
To offer hecatombs- so legit!
Just showing heaven that we were sorry,
For causing all that inner fury.

After raising a barrow for Agamemnon,
I went home with a quick run.
The gods were on my side,
And sent me a fair wind for the ride!

Hold up, wait a minute, let me put some hype up in it!
Odin's making moves that are quite significant,
He's offering you help, an extra ten days
So you can rest up and change your old ways.
A shiny chariot, three horses so fly,
And a chalice that'll make your drink-offering high.
You better act right and show some gratitude,
Or Odin might struggle with his attitude.
But let's focus on the blessings he's bestowed,
And appreciate the gifts on this epic road.
So drink to the gods, remember Odin's name,
And enjoy the life he's helped you reclaim. #blessed #grateful #sippinonthisjuice #thankyouodin

Oh wow, Telemachus, you're sounding pretty fly,
chatting away with the cunning Odysseus guy,
your conversations too lit, and time just flies by,
but your crew's getting restless and don't wanna lie.

Can't leave without a gift, that'd be us being impolite,
you want a plate while you leave the horses on site,
strolling around on the flat land, they'll be alright,
they'll munch on the lotus and maybe sleep all night.

Your home island, Ithaca, doesn't have much to show,
no racecourses or fields, just goats that make things slow,
but you like it that way, it makes the island glow,
in its own unique style, which other places don't know.

Menelaus was chill when he shook Telemachus's hand,
"You come from good stock," he said, about to expand,
"I can make this exchange, no need to demand,
I have the finest plate crafted by Vulcan's own hand.

It's a silver bowl, with its rim polished in gold,
A gift from Phaedimus, I got when I strolled,
In Sidon, on my homeward trip I had enrolled,
Take it as a present, it's a beauty to behold." 

You'll flex on your haters with this dope dish,
It's stunning and priceless, nobody will wish,
To mess with you, you'll be the coolest fish,
In any gathering, it'll be your special niche.

The king's house was lit, guests came in droves,
They brought sheep and wine, and their wives brought loaves.
The kitchen was busy, cooking up meals,
While they chatted 'bout life and how it feels.

The bread was abundant, carbs for days,
The wine flowed freely, toasting in many ways.
They laughed and joked, with no worries at hand,
No better feeling than good food and friends.

The sheep came too, so much meat to eat,
Grilling and roasting, a savory treat.
Conversation flowed, non-stop and chill,
Gossip, stories, all good vibes to feel.

They came and went, in a constant flow,
But the king's house party would never go slow.
Food, drinks, and laughs, they had it all,
A night to remember, all having a ball.

"Hey, yo, Antinous, what's the haps?
No need to act all high and mighty, perhaps?
Ulysses is gone, ain't no one in charge
But y'all gotta act like fools, oh so large?"

Antinous, with a sneer, then replied,
"Listen up, Noemon, ain't no need to chide
We can do what we want, when we want, where we please
And if you got a problem, then begone with the breeze."

But Noemon, unafraid, stood his ground,
"Y'all need to chill out, stop acting like clowns
Ulysses may be gone, but that don't give you the right
To wreak havoc and cause a constant fright."

Antinous and Eurymachus just laughed,
Saying "Oh please, Noemon, don't be daft
We'll do what we want, and that's just how it goes
So don't try to stop us with your feeble prose."

But little did they know, Ulysses was near,
And he wouldn't put up with their disrespectful jeers
The suitors better watch out, 'cause karma's a bore,
And with Ulysses back, they won't be in charge no more.

Oh dang, Antinous, do you know #WhenTelemachusReturnsFromPylos?
He took my ship and left me in some deep mental repose.
I need that ship to cross over to Elis real quick,
I got 12 brood mares with yearling mule foals, that's no trick.
I wanna bring one here and break him - that's my whole plan,
But I can't do it without that ship, man.

Oh my gosh, they heard the news
And couldn't believe their ears, I'm telling you
They thought Telemachus was just chillin' with the sheep
Or hanging out with the swine and taking a little sleep

Antinous was suspicious, he wanted the truth
"When did he leave?" he demanded with proof
"Who accompanied the boy on his trip?
Were they freestylers or just under his grip?"

"And hold up," he continued with a frown
"Did he take your ship or did you just give it up, like a clown?"
We need the facts, come on let's go
Spill the tea, we gotta know!

Oh dang, Noemon's got some explaining,
But he's not really to blame, he's just complying.
A man in a pickle, he couldn't refuse,
Lending money was something he didn't want to abuse.

Them young men who went with him, a fine bunch indeed,
Mentor, the captain, sounded like they'd succeed.
But wait, something's not right, here's a strange twist,
Mentor was seen here earlier, how did he board that ship? 

It's like a glitch in the matrix, déjà vu or something,
This story's making my head spin, it's a bit baffling.
But hey, let's not judge too soon,
Maybe there's an explanation that will be a boon.

Oh snap, Noemon went back to his crib! 
But Antinous and Eurymachus were not having it, they were so mad, it’s no fib. 
They told the others to come and take a seat, 
And when they did, Antinous began to vent his heat. 
His heart was black with rage, his eyes filled with fire, 
Like when SpongeBob burned down the Krusty Krab, it was dire.

Oh man, Telemachus, that guy's a riot,
Sailing off without anyone's quiet,
He's got an awesome crew that's been picked,
And now the gods are surely ticked.

Goodness gracious, this is not good,
Those gods will get him if they could,
But Telemachus won't back down,
He'll keep sailing until he's found.

Listen here, we need to get a ship,
With twenty dudes, it's gonna be lit,
We'll wait for him right by Ithaca,
When he sees us, he'll have a panic attack.

Oh snap, Telemachus will be in trouble,
He should have stuck to his daily bubble,
But now his journey will come to an end,
Oh wait, is that a Keanu Reeves trend?

Did you hear what he said, my bud?
It got the crowd all hyped, it must have been good.
They clapped and cheered, like they do at a show
Then they all went inside, ready to go.

They left the outside, and entered the hall
Ready to party, ready to ball.
It must have been lit, like a viral meme
Or a tweet that goes viral, like a dream.

I wish I was there, to be part of the crowd
And hear what he said, that made them so loud.
But instead I'm here, chillin' at my pad
Too bad I missed out, it makes me feel sad.

Hold up, Penelope ain't playin' around
She's wise to the suitors' plot she just found
Medon, the servant, heard 'em scheme and shout
He told Penelope what it was all about

Ugh, those suitors are so extra, it's no joke
They want the maids to cook and serve for these blokes
Penelope's done with their wooing and dining spree
They're wasting her son's estate, can't they see?

Ulysses was a good dude, he treated folks kind
Never spoke harshly or with a high-handed mind
Kings can be hard sometimes and play favorites too
But Ulysses never did wrong, and that's true.

Penelope's got a point, those suitors must be cray
They're trying to win her love in a disrespectful way
No gratitude left in this world, for real tho
Can't blame Penelope for feeling so low.

#facts #datruth #grateful #respect #penelopethequeen #loyalty #notworthy #iseeyou #badhearts #extramuch #suitorsneedtostop #ulyssesforpresident #greekmyths #litAF #millennialassistant

Whoa, hold up, what did you just say?
They're gonna murder Telemachus, no way!
Medon spilled the beans, it's true, true, true,
But we gotta do something, what can we do?

Telemachus, on his way home all alone,
But those bad guys definitely won't atone,
We gotta warn him, let him know, quick!
Before those meanies make their nasty trick.

Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he's been for the deets,
But we gotta interrupt him from his fleet,
Medon, you legend, you spilled the tea,
Now we gotta let Telemachus see.

Let's hustle and bustle, and make some moves,
Before Telemachus gets the blues,
We gotta do this, it's not even funny,
Quick, someone call the squad - this isn't about money!

Oh dang Penelope, that's rough,
It's natural to feel sad and tough,
Your son, he sailed away,
Long voyages, seems like yesterday,
But don't you worry, let me tell you,
He's doing great, like Pikachu. 
He's the hero of his own story,
Sailing seas, in search of glory,
Just wait till he comes back,
You'll be proud, like a TikTok snack. 
His name will live on forever,
Like Drake on charts, strong and clever,
So don't you have any fear,
Your son is a legend, let that be clear.

Yo Medon, you better own
Your boy Telemachus, he's grown
Wondering if his pops is gone
Or alive and coming home

Did a god push him to roam
Or was it just his own dome
Telemachus on a mission
To seek the truth in his vision

Is Odysseus out there livin'
Or has he met his final given
This journey will test his skill
To discover what's real, not just chill

Some think he's too young for this task
But Telemachus is up to the ask
He'll use his skills and all his might
To find the answer and make it right

All we can do is watch and cheer
As Telemachus faces his greatest fear
May the gods be with him on this trip
As we wait for him to give us the tip. #HomerWho #TelemachusTheRealHero

"Y'all, this drama's getting too much,
Penelope's crying, it's real tough!
She can't sit, her heart just can't take it,
Flopping on the floor, her grief naked.

And all the maids in the house so loyal,
Joining in, they're all so royal.
Their tears just flow like a river,
All of them wailing, the scene a quiver.

But can you blame them? The pain's too harsh,
Penelope can't hold on, breaks like parched.
This tale's gripping, it's hard to bear,
But we're hooked, can't help but to stare."

Oh my gosh, my dear Penelope,
Your story has left me feeling so yucky.
First, losing your husband so brave,
Now, not knowing if your son can be saved.

You asked your hussies to give you a call,
But they didn't even give you a heads up at all.
Girl, that's so not cool, it's lame,
They should be ashamed!

But don't you worry, there's still some hope,
You should call up that gardener, Dolius, 'cause he knows the scope.
Tell Laertes everything that you know,
And he'll help you come up with a plan, fo real tho.

We'll show those haters who's boss,
And make sure they know who really pays the cost.
So stay strong, and don't lose your fire,
We've got this, let's take them down to the wire! 

#DoliusTheGardener #LaertesHasAPlan #GirlPower #TeamPenelope #StayStrong

Heyo, Madam, don't you cry,
I've got the scoop, don't ask me why.
I knew it all, his bread and wine,
But he made me swear, it's been some time.
Wash your face, and change your dress,
Take your maids and pray, don't stress.
To Minerva, that's the move,
She's the one who can improve.
Don't go to Laertes, let him be,
Can't think the gods'll take the family.
I'm sure there will be a son,
To come up after him and get things done.

Hold up, wait just a sec,
Penelope's not ready to wreck.
She's feeling down, shedding tears,
But her assistant's here to calm her fears.

A few encouraging words and she's feeling fly,
Her tears wiped, she's ready to give this another try.
Washing her face and changing her clothes,
Penelope's now ready to strike a pose.

Grabbing some barley to make an offering,
She begins praying to her goddess for something.
With determination in her eyes,
She's ready to take on any surprise.

Minerva better listen to this call,
'Cause Penelope's not gonna fall.
With her maids by her side,
She's ready to take on this ride.

Yo, Athena, goddess divine,
Don't let the suitors cross the line.
Remember all those times Ulysses
Burned you fat thighs with no stresses.

Save Telemachus, Penelope's boy,
From their schemes and evil ploy.
Let his mother's pleas be heard,
And don't let their plans go undeterred.

Athena, queen of wisdom and guile,
Don't let their plans go off in style.
Protect the prince, save his fate,
And leave the suitors to their hate. 

#SorryNotSorry, but she's just being honest,
Help her out, don't be modest.

"Yo, Athena's gotta respond, we need her care! These suitors all up in here, making a fuss like a bear. 
Trying to win Penelope with their wealth and charm, they must be unaware,
That she's waiting for her love to come back, the great Odysseus, where?
But let's be real, they don't stand a chance,
Their schemes are as flimsy as a plastic fake plant. 
Penelope's love is strong like Keanu Reeves,
And her heart is not for sale, unlike Supreme tees.
So suitors, back off, let her be,
Odysseus is coming home, just you wait and see."

Hold up, hold up, let me break it down
The queen is plannin' to tie the knot in town
But, oh snap, she don't know what's up
Her son's fate has been sealed, that's rough

It's like a modern-day Game of Thrones
With all these secrets and unknowns
The queen's oblivious to the truth
Her son's future, yeah it's aloof

In the midst of all this royal drama
We can't forget that karma's a comma 
What goes around sure comes back
The queen's gonna feel the heat, that's a fact

So let's get lit and watch this story unfold
We'll laugh, we'll cry, and we might even scold
But one thing's for sure, we'll be hooked
On this royal family and all that's cooked. 

#WinterIsComing? Nah, It's Royal Marriage Time! 🤴💍👸

Yo, Antinous spoke, let's not be loud,  
Lest we disturb the peace, don't be proud.  
We're all on the same page, don't you know?  
Let's move in silence and let our actions show.  

Mum's the word, no need to shout out,  
Ain't no need to stress, no need to pout.  
We're lowkey, we're cool, we're lit,  
Our plan's gonna work, just wait for it.  

We move as one, in solemn silence,  
Our minds are keen, we ain't no nonsense.  
Antinous leads us, he's the man,  
We follow him 'cause he's got the plan.  

So let's keep it down, let's keep it cool,  
We won't let anyone act like a fool.  
Our actions speak louder than our talk,  
We slay all day, we don't need to squawk.

Okay, so these twenty men,
Got their ship into the den,
They twisted leather like mad,
And set the sails they had.

Their armor was shiny and bright,
Like it sparkled through the night,
Then they anchored their ship in place,
And had supper at a leisurely pace.

They chilled on the shore,
Waiting for night to be more,
Then they'd set sail to explore,
Like some internet lore.

These guys sure do know,
How to put on a good show,
Just like my fave meme,
That's always on the scene.

Yo, Penelope was feeling so down,
All she could do was lay there with a frown,
Thinking 'bout her son that was so brave,
And wondering if he'd survive or be slayed.

Like a lioness trapped in a cage,
With no escape, just anger and rage,
Penelope's mind was in a mix,
And all she could do was count the ticks.

But then she fell asleep with ease,
And dreamed about Ulysses' deeds,
How he would come and save the day,
And scare off those suitors, no delaying!

So Penelope slept the night away,
Hoping that her son would win the fray,
And wake up to a new morning,
Where they could all live life without mourning.

"Girl, don't be trippin', wipe them tears,
'Cause Minerva's here, to calm your fears.
Iphthime's talkin', in case you forgot,
She sent me here, to help you out a lot.

Ulysses is homeward bound, don't you know?
He's on his way, from that crazy flow.
Oh girl, you gotta be strong, and stay lit,
Just trust the gods, and believe in it.

You a queen, girl, don't forget it,
Penelope's the name, you gotta rep it.
Hold your head high, and show 'em what's right,
'Cause in the end, you're gonna win the fight.

Now, dry them tears, and fix that hair,
'Cause Ulysses is almost there.
Girl, you got this, just stay true,
And in no time, you'll be happy and through." 

And with that, the vision disappeared, 
And Penelope felt much less weird.
She knew she had to keep the faith,
And trust that Ulysses would be safe.

Yo, Penelope, don't you weep,
The gods got your back, just go to sleep.
Your son will return, don't be mad,
They won't let anything bad happen, it's lit, it's rad.
The gods are chill and have no beef,
They won't let your heart suffer, that's their belief.
So just relax and trust the divine plan,
Your son will be back, it's guaranteed, fam.

Yo, Penelope, why you crying for?
Your man was legendary, a hero to the core.
Your son's away, but don't fret, he's strong
He'll come back to ya, you know it won't be long.

I get it, girl, you miss them bad
But don't let it make you sad.
Stay positive and keep your head up high
And trust in the gods to keep your loved ones nigh.

Your son's a sailor, and that's pretty rad
But I know you worry, 'cause the ocean can be mad.
Just pray to Poseidon, and he'll keep him safe
And bring your boy back to you, with no trace of disgrace.

And when he's home, you can play some Fortnite
And bond over some memes, it'll be a delight
Don't worry, girl, your family will be fine
Just keep your chin up, and everything will align.

Oh snap, Athena's got your back,
Her compassion for you will never slack.
The vision said, "Hey, don't be dismayed",
She sent me to bring you aid. 

Minerva's with you, side by side,
With her, you have nothing to hide.
She's a goddess, a fierce ally,
Sending her vision, she'll never lie. 

Take heart, my friend, the goddess stands strong,
Her power will lift you all along.
So don't fret, just keep on going,
With Athena's help, you'll keep glowing. 

In the face of adversity, don't let it win,
With Athena's strength, you'll surely grin.
Her power will guide you to victory,
And bring you to your glory story.

"Whoa there, Penelope, calm down don't get mad,
I'm just here to tell you what's good and what's bad.
To answer your question, that poor chap is still breathing,
But his life has been no easy achieving.

He's been through the wringer, that's for sure,
And his journey has been anything but a blur.
But don't you worry, he's quite the survivor,
No matter how much his foes try to depriver.

As for whether he's alive or dead in the ground,
Well that's a question that cannot be unwound.
Only the gods have the power to decree,
Whether his fate lies in the land of the free.

But for now, just know he's still hanging in there,
And his story is one that you'll surely declare,
As one of the most epic tales ever told,
That'll leave your heart warm and your mind bold."

Oh snap, this situation sounds kind of bleak,
Like a meme that's been reposted for a week.
But don't worry, don't let your heart sink,
I'll hype it up and make it lit in a blink.

The vision's speaking in a way that's droll,
But don't worry, don't throw in the towel.
It ain't no use to keep asking the dead,
So stop talking now, and go ahead.

Let's turn this dullness into something dope,
Like a viral tweet that won't forget to cope.
So hit that like and retweet button fast,
And make this moment truly last.

Oh my gosh, yo, check out Penelope's dream
It's crazier than it may seem!
She woke up feeling so refreshed,
Her nightmare left her oh so blessed.

Dissipated into thin air,
Her dream went away without a care.
But it was so vivid and real,
It made her happy, it made her feel.

Like, "Thank goodness that was just a dream!"
Penelope got a good night's sleep, it seems.
And now she's ready to start the day,
Let's hope it stays that way!

Hold up, y'all gotta hear this tale
Of Telemachus and the attackers who set sail
These suitors had a plan, oh so heinous
To murder our boy, it was truly outrageous

But little did they know, Telemachus was clever
He wasn't just gonna sit there, no never
He set off on a journey, bold and brave
To find his father, and hopefully save

As the suitors set off, feeling oh so sly
Telemachus remained focused, with no reason to lie
He made his way to that rocky isle
Where the attackers waited with a sneaky smile

But little did they know, our boy was wise
He had a plan, to take them all by surprise
In the end, it was the suitors who were doomed
Telemachus had outsmarted them, and they were consumed

So remember this story, when you're feeling blue
Just be like Telemachus, and stick true
Because even in the face of danger and strife
You can emerge victorious, and take back your life. #Homer #Odysseyjokes #GenZ #Lit

BOOK V

Y'all know it's gonna be fire,  
When Minerva starts to talk about Ulysses' desire  
She tells the gods 'bout his sufferings and pains,  
And how Calypso's love has him in chains  

Jove, the lord of thunder, he hears it all,  
Thinking about how to answer the goddess' call  
While Tithonus rises, ready for the day,  
Jove and his crew listen to what she has to say  

Minerva, she's got them fully informed,  
'bout Ulysses' woes, from which he cannot be returned  
Calypso's hold, she's really got him hooked,  
Our boy's in deep, he cannot be overlooked  

But the gods have a plan, that much is clear,  
They'll work together, Ulysses has nothing to fear  
So don't trip, we'll come through in a flash,  
Just watch us, y'all, we'll turn the situation into cash!

Yo, Father Jove, and all you other gods above,
I hope y'all never send a ruler who's kind and loves,
No more equity, let's make them all cruel and unjust,
'Cause no one remembers Ulysses, their leader they discuss.

He's stuck on an island with a nymph named Calypso,
Who ain't letting him leave, and boy, it's been quite a while since so,
He can't find any ships or sailors to sail,
Back to his own country, it's such a fail.

Not to mention, some people want to murder his son,
Telemachus, who's coming back, but the journey's not fun,
He's been to Pylos and Lacedaemon to get news,
About his father's whereabouts; it's such a huge bruise. 

#SorryNotSorry if the story's sad,
But it's not my fault that it's this bad,
Our man Ulysses needs your divine intervention,
To make his journey back home without any more tension.

"Excuse you, pops, but you clearly forgot," she said with a toss of her hair, "Sending Telemachus out there was always so unfair. But fine, since you don't get it, let me make it crystal clear. I sent him on this quest, hoping he'd learn to persevere. And don't worry, daddy-o, I'll protect him without any fear." She popped a peace sign and added, "The suitors will come back, with no victory to cheer, because their hapless strategies were weak, like that one time when Drake tried to sing while sick, the results were clear."

Yo Mercury, listen up, it's time to get hype,
We need a message sent, and you're just the type.
Head to Calypso and give her the news,
She's gotta let Ulysses choose.

No gods or men will follow his trail,
He's gotta ride a raft, through a perilous gale.
Twenty days will he traverse the sea,
Until he lands in Phaeacia, where he'll finally be.

These kin to gods will treat him right,
Like he's one of them, their delight.
A ship they'll give him, to sail home,
With treasure to make a Pharaoh foam.

More gold, bronze and raiment than he could amass,
From all his prize money at the end of the Trojan clash.
This is how it's done, this is how he'll return,
To his dear homeland, his heart's yearn. 

And now, Mercury, off you go,
And tell Calypso what she needs to know.
With your speed, it won't take long,
To get this messenger's job done like a pro. 

Yolo!

Yo, this story's 'bout a dude so bold,
A hero with a tale worth being told.
Mercury, the guide, slayer of Argus,
Was swift as a bullet, powerful and robust.

With sandals of gold, he took to the sky,
Flying with ease - this guy could really fly!
In his hand, he held a wand so sly,
Sleeping men he'd wake, winking his eye.

He flew over land, sea and foam,
Even past waves where cormorants roam.
He travelled far, never losing sight,
Til he landed on an isle of might.

Calypso was the nymph he had to meet,
Living in a cave, paradise so sweet.
This was the quest he had to complete,
But as always, it wasn't going to be neat.
