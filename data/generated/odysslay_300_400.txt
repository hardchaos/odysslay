Yo, check out these Phaeacians, they're not fake,
They're headed to some sports, make no mistake.
Demodocus's lyre is hangin' on its peg,
This event's gonna be lit, like a viral meme saga.

A crowd of thousands is following the crowd,
The prizes are poppin', the competitors are proud.
Acroneos, Ocyalus, and Prymneus are here,
Elatreus, Nauteus, Anchialus, they're all cheer.

Euryalus is the Mars-lookin' guy,
The girls will be screaming, they won't even try to be sly.
Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, too,
Step up to the plate, they're ready to woo.

The sons of Alcinous know how to ball,
They're ready to go, ready to give their all.
This competition is fierce, like a Twitter fight,
The winner will be crowned tonight.

Yo, let me tell you of this stranger, he's got power
His build is impressive, it's quite the shower
He's faced the sea and all its wrath
But can he beat our champions on this path?

First were the foot races, a sight to see
Clytoneus won by a length, he's speedy, you'll agree
Next up was wrestling, and Euryalus took the crown
Amphialus jumped the farthest, he earned that renown

Elatreus threw the disc like a pro
No one could match him, not even close, bro
Then there was boxing, Laodamas reigned supreme
But can this stranger, with his muscles, join our team?

Now, let's ask him, the man of the hour
Does he excel in anything? Give us the power!
He's suffered much, we can tell, but his strength remains
Let's see if he can handle our sporting domains.

Oh snap, Euryalus. No need to be a buzzkill,
Laodamas just wants to show some hospitality skill.
But if you think you got this, go ahead, give it a try,
Talk to your guest, maybe offer him some pie.

It's all good, Laodamas won't feel no type of way,
Just trying to make his guest feel welcome and okay.
But if you don't wanna help, that's cool too,
Just don't be surprised if your guest says adieu.

Yo Laodamas, you're right on time
Challenging Ulysses to an event that's prime
He's got skills, don't you see?
Hands and feet, proper man he'll be

Ulysses, show them what you got
Try anything, give it a shot
Skillful in many, he'll take them all
No need to worry, he'll stand tall

Don't let sorrow fill your mind
Let's leave all the bad stuff behind
The ship awaits and the crew is set
Your homecoming moments will be jet

Yo Laodamas, why you playin' with me this way? 
My head ain't in the game, I got bigger things to say.
I've been through the ringer, my troubles are sky high,
Now I'm here before you, begging you to comply.

I'm asking for your help, your king and your nation,
To aid me on my way back to my own station.
Home is where my heart is, I need to get there fast,
So please don't make this hard for me, just make it last.

I'm not here to compete, no need for contests or debate,
Just trying to get back to where I belong, before it's too late.
So if you see me struggling, don't add to my trials and strife,
Just lend me a helping hand and let me get on with my life.

Hold up, Euryalus, why you gotta be so mean?
Flexing your athletic skills is just plain obscene.
Not all of us are built for sports or physical might,
But that doesn't mean we can't win at life, am I right?

Maybe this dude's a captain or a merchant, that's fine,
They're hustling hard and making bank all the time.
Just because he's not ripped or jacked to the max,
Doesn't mean he can't handle business and stack up his racks.

Don't judge a book by its cover, that's so 2010,
Let's focus on the substance and not on our ends.
We're all unique and have different things we're good at,
So let's lift each other up instead of being a brat.

Plus, who knows what hidden talents this guy might have?
Maybe he's a trader by day and a ninja by night, that's rad.
So let's chill with the insults and give him some respect,
'Cause being a well-rounded person is what's really correct.

"Hey, hold up, dude," Ulysses said,
"You're acting like a real cornbread.
Not everyone's blessed with mad skill, 
Some just got looks, that's the deal.

But see, that's where you messed up, son,
Talkin' smack, thinkin' you won.
I got the talent, the strength, the might,
I used to win battles and sports fights.

Sure, I may be old and weary,
But I'll still show you, don't be leery.
You got me heated, it's not cool,
So let's compete, and I'll make you the fool."

Dang, he's a braniac, got skillz for days 
With a toss so tight, it cuts like a blade 
The Phaeacians stood no chance, just amazed 
As the disc went soaring, into the sun's rays 

Minerva, as a dude, went to see the prize 
Where the disc did land, far from mortal eyes 
"Bro, you're killing it!" she said, with surprise 
"There's no way anyone can beat your high rise." 

So he won the contest, without being vexed 
A true athlete, he proved to be the best 
The Phaeacians just shrugged, feeling perplexed 
"Yo, he's got the moves, he outdid the rest!"

Yo, Ulysses was on the savage grind
Challenging the young men, losing no time
He could throw the disc like it was light
And he wasn't afraid to put up a fight

But wait, he said, hold up, pause
Laodamas, he couldn't impose
He was the homie, don't want to compete
It ain't wise, especially when not on home street

But anyone else, come on and bring it
Ulysses was ready, didn't even flinch
He could box, wrestle, and even run
He was down for whatever, he was that fun

He was an archer, the best you ever saw
In battle, shooting from afar
No matter the number, he always won
He was the one, get it done

Hercules and Eurytus, they were legends at bow
So Ulysses backed down, he just couldn't go
And throwing a dart? He was the king
No one came close, no one could swing

He was honest though, his weakness was clear
Running was a tough one, too much fear
But no matter what, Ulysses didn't crack
He was always on point, no turning back. 

Lit, throwin' those discs like it's nothing
Ulysses was flexin', he wasn't bluffin'
And as for running, he wasn't the best
But that doesn't mean he couldn't ace the rest!

Yo, King Alcinous spittin' some facts,
Saying they're the masters in many an act.
Not great with their fists, nor wrestling, you see,
But they're speedy and seafaring, trust me.

They love lavish dinners and bust a move to the beat,
Wearing clean linen, getting warm baths, the heat.
Demodocus left his lyre, oh no,
But they gon' get it, and put on a show.

Dancers, bring your best moves, impress the guest,
Let him go home, and tell everyone the rest.
How they're the greatest in all the land,
Running, dancing, singing, a talented band.

As the servant hustled off, the stewards took the stage
To make the ground bounce like it was the main rage
They smoothed the surface fast, so nothing was left to chance
And marked out a wide area, worthy of the dance!
The servant then returned bearing Demodocus's lyre
And the dancers took over with moves that were on fire
Their feet were lithe and nimble, moving to the beat
And Ulysses was super impressed, tapping his feet.


OK, OK, gather round, let me tell you a story,
'Bout Mars and Venus - you know, they got kinda gory.
Their love was forbidden, but they couldn't stop.
And with Vulcan away, they just had to swap.

Mars gave Venus gifts, made her feel oh-so-fine,
Even though their actions were such a crime.
They did it in Vulcan's bed, that was really low.
And the sun saw it all, said "Yo, bro!"

Vulcan was pissed, he had to take action.
So he went to his forge, with some serious traction.
He made some chains, that were super strong,
So that they couldn't escape, no matter how long.

He put them all over the bed, with such great care,
And when it was done, it was like a spider's lair.
No one could even see them, they were so fine,
But they were strong enough to hold, every time.

And then, just like that, Vulcan was gone,
Mars and Venus, thought the coast was clear, oh so wrong.
Mars went to her house, burning with passion,
Not knowing he was walking into his own last season.

But listen up, y'all, this story's not done,
Will Mars and Venus escape, or be ultimately undone?
Stay tuned, my friends, there's more to come,
This is just the beginning of a tale, that's hot like the sun.

Yo Venus and Mars, such a power couple,
Mars wants to go to Vulcan's house on the double.
But Vulcan's out, he's gone far away,
To Lemnos he travels, with no time for delay.

Their hands locked tight with love so strong,
Off they go, life's not too long.
But wait, what's that? There's trouble brewing,
This story's getting juicy, it's worth pursuing.

Listen up, fam, this ain't no joke,
These two are caught in Vulcan's poke,
He made a trap, so sly and neat,
And now they're trapped upon the seat.

Vulcan was mad, he'd figured out,
What Aphrodite and Ares were about,
His fury raged, he made a fuss,
Calling out to all the gods like it's a must. 

But Aphrodite, she ain't no fool,
All that noise was just too uncool,
She said to Ares with a sassy grin,
"We gotta bounce outta this trap we're in."

With a wink and a nod, they made their move,
Slipping out, they had nothing to prove,
Vulcan was left in his own dismay,
Another day, another trap, it's all just play. 

So now you know, the story of these three,
Caught in a trap that wasn't meant to be,
But when it comes to love and war,
Anything can happen, that's for sure.

"Yo, Father Jove, you gotta hear this, it's wild,
A sight that's ridiculous and makes me feel so riled.
See Venus here, she's causing such drama
Always dishonoring me for my physical schema. 

She's head over heels for Mars, he's a sight to see
Compared to me, he's clean-built and he's worry-free.
I may be a cripple, but I can't help this condition
My parents are to blame, it wasn't my decision.

Come and check out this pair for yourself
Sleeping on my bed like it's a bookstore shelf.
It gets me angry, it gets me so damn mad
To see them so happy, it's really quite sad.

But I don't think they'll stay there for too long 
Mars and Venus, they ain't that strong.
And they won't be sleeping much, that's for sure
They'll be up soon, that much I know for sure.

But let them stay there till her father pays his dues,
For his baggage of a daughter, who's only fair, but not tru(e)s."

"Hold up, this tea is getting hotter!" 
Each god was amazed, they couldn't believe,
That Vulcan could pull off such a trick up his sleeve.
Mercury exclaimed, "That was lucky, bro!"
While Neptune joked, "Vulcan's flames sure do glow!"
King Apollo just shook his head and sighed,
"Vulcan always impresses, I can't deny."
As they laughed and cheered, the goddesses missed out,
But no worries, they'll learn what life's all about.

Yo, let me break it down for ya,
Ill deeds never gonna prosper   
Limping Vulcan made it clearer
Weak ones can put down the stronger

Vulcan caught Mars like a boss
Hobbled in and took him down
Mars, the fleetest god with a loss
Looks like he'll get sued in town

Lame as Vulcan may appear
He still managed to catch the God of War
Now Mars will face some hefty fear
Thanks to Vulcan's clever chore

So remember this lesson true
Strength ain't always the winning key
A little trickery can get you through
Just like Vulcan's victory

Oh snap, Apollo coming in hot
With some scandalous talk that we’ve got
Messenger Mercury, oh he’s sly
Giver of good things, but this convo's why?

If chains were strong, he asks with a grin
Would Mercury mind sleeping with Venus, his sin?
Apollo, your words are wild and surreal
This drama got me like, “oh, I can’t deal!”

But seriously, let’s break it down
Apollo’s comments are shaking this town
Chains or no chains, what’s the deal with Venus?
Is there more to this story? Don’t leave us.

As your assistant, I’ll bring the hype
Mercury, Apollo, and Venus, what a tripe
Let’s get to the bottom of this scandalous plot
This juicy drama is hitting the spot!

Yo, Mercury's got bars, just like he's got wings,
He's trying to get with someone who's royalty, who sings.
He's talking 'bout Queen Olympe, a goddess so fine,
He'd break any chains just to make her his Valentine.

Mercury's got game, he's smooth like no other,
He'd slide in her DMs, and he wouldn't bother.
He knows he can't be with her, yet he daydreams,
A god with the hots for a goddess, it seems.

But wait, did I hear him say "if I could"?
Does that mean he can't get what he would?
Apollo's the king, he's got all eyes on him,
Mercury's just trying, but the odds are slim.

So let's sit back, and watch this play out,
Mercury's trying to score, no doubt.
Maybe one day, he'll have his chance,
To be with the queen, and do a little dance.

Oh dang, Neptune's in a tough spot,          
Trying to get Vulcan to let Mars rot         
But Vulcan's not having it, he wants some cash         
Damage fees for the gods, Neptune's gotta dash         
It's a sticky situation, like spilled tea on my shirt         
But I hope they work it out, and Mars doesn't get hurt         
Maybe they can settle it with a quick game of Fortnite         
Or go viral on TikTok, now that would be tight!

Vulcan spoke up with a snap, 
"A bad man's bond is complete crap! 
What security would I receive, 
If Mars decides to deceive 
And run away with chains and debts, 
Leaving me to deal with all his regrets?" 

I mean, seriously, what can I do? 
It's not like I have a clue 
To force him to pay up his dues, 
Mars really must choose 
To stay and face the music, 
Or else the consequences will be quite tragic. 

This is like when someone owes you cash, 
But they decide to make a mad dash 
And disappear into thin air, 
Leaving you to just sit and stare 
At the empty wallet in your hand, 
While they dance off to some faraway land.

Yo, Neptune said with a snap, 
If Mars dips out, I'll cover the gap. 
Vulcan nodded and said he agreed, 
He couldn't refuse, he has a friend in need. 

No need to worry, no need to fret, 
My wallet's got it, no need to get upset. 
Vulcan's all good, he's got a flex, 
He knows Neptune's got a high-tech and sleek Rolex. 

So chill out, relax, catch a break, 
No need to fuss, no need to shake. 
Cause when the gods come out to play, 
There's no need to worry or feel dismay.

Yo, did you hear what just went down?
Mars and Venus, they once wore a frown,
But then they got freed and without a sound,
They dashed off to lands that they found.

Mars went straight to Thrace,
And I bet he set himself a fast pace.
Venus, on the other hand,
Went to Paphos, a destination so grand.

In Cyprus, she was greeted by the Graces,
And they gave her anointing with the most expensive bases.
They put on her some fashion so fly,
It was like throwing fireworks in the sky.

She was dressed in ambrosia oil so pure,
The kind that only gods can procure.
Clothing so ethereal,
She shone like a real material.

That's what happens when gods get freed,
They go and do exactly what they need.
Now let's hope their freedom does not lead
To anything we should dread or misread.

Oh my days, did you hear the way he played?
Ulysses and the Phaeacians were amazed!
That bard's voice was smooth like butter,
His tune was lit! I can't even mutter.

They were charmed as they listened with glee,
Did you see them swaying so effortlessly?
The bard's words had them feeling alive,
His lyrics reaching deep down inside.

I bet they will remember this moment,
Like a meme that goes viral, it's potent.
They'll rave about that bard's sick flow,
To everyone they meet, they'll let it be known!

"Yo, that ball be flyin' high up in the sky!
Laodamas and Halius, they know how to fly!
Their dance moves lit, keepin' the ball in the air,
Got the crowd hyped, they just can't compare!

But hold up, y'all, let me throw down some advice,
I may be old but I'm still twice as nice,
Why don't you add a little spice to the game,
Some new moves that'll bring you fame?

I'll show you how to mix it up with some swag,
Make the crowd go wild, snag a victory tag,
So don't be afraid to take some risks,
And trust me, you'll be the ones who get the kicks!"

Oh snap, King Alcinous, you weren't lying,
Your people are the dancing kings, my oh my-ing!
Their moves were so lit, I was truly awed,
I couldn't believe my eyes, I was totally floored.

They were nimble like cats, they were smooth like jazz,
Their rhythm was on point, they were hotter than hash.
I couldn't help but wonder, where did they learn these skills?
I need to take some lessons, I need to up my thrills.

But seriously, your folks are the bomb dot com,
I'll never forget it, even when I'm gone.
Thanks for the show, it was straight up awesome,
I was feeling the vibes, I was in the zone-dom.

Yo, this king is straight up chill,
Offering gifts, like it's no big deal.
He's impressed by our boy's judgment,
And wants to show him love without end.

The aldermen and town councillors,
Are down to contribute to the visitors.
They'll each give a shirt and cloak so clean,
Plus some fine gold, fit for a king and queen.

Our visitor will dine with a light heart,
And be gifted with more than just a start.
But Euryalus made a mistake,
Being rude wasn't something they could take.

He'll need to make a formal apology,
And give a gift that's not that cheap, you see.
This culture may be ancient and old,
But we can still learn from these stories told.

Oh my gosh, did you hear what he said?
Euryalus offered a gift, worth what we're told, 
A sword of bronze, shining bright like gold! 
The hilt of his gift, a silver treasure, 
And a scabbard made of ivory, nothing lesser. 

Can't you see the stranger's eyes, full of wonder,
Thinking to himself, "I must have blundered."
But Euryalus was kind, with generosity so bold,
He offered a sword and scabbard worth their weight in gold. 

Now, let me tell you something real quick,
Euryalus just made the stranger's day, no need to be slick.
The stranger sat amazed, feeling like a star,
Wondering if Euryalus came from near or far. 

But let's praise Euryalus, for his generous deeds,
He didn't hesitate, fulfillng the stranger's needs. 
So let's give it up for Euryalus, a true hero,
Who deserves a meme or two, oh let them flow!

Oh my gosh, this moment's lit,
A sword transfer? That's some legit sh*t.
Ulysses, take care and good luck to ya,
Hope the gods shine down and bless ya.
Away from home for so long, that's rough,
You've definitely had it tough.
May the winds blow away any mistakes made,
And a safe return home, the universe has prayed.

Ulysses said with swag, "Bruh you too, hope life's a vibe, no cap that's true. I won't front, your sword was dope, but don't stress, I'll still survive and cope."

Yo, check it, let me hype up this scene,
Like a boss, it's a whole lit dream,
Alcinous flexin', lookin' like a king,
With presents pourin' in, it's a whole new thing.

The servants bring the presents through the door,
Alcinous' sons receive them like a pro,
Mom's in charge, she's got it under control,
This family's righteous, they got heart and soul.

Alcinous leads the way, what a vibe,
The guests take their seats, they're feeling alive,
The house is bumpin', like a beat dropped low,
These homies chillin', it's a lit af show.

So let me wrap this up, with all my swag,
This crew is vibrant like a colorful rag,
They're family goals, a whole new level,
This story's fire, like a trending meme devil!

Oh my god, did you hear what he said?
He asked his wife to get the best chest instead,
Of course, it's not what you think,
A chest full of clothes that doesn't stink.

He asked for a clean cloak and shirt,
So his guest won't look like a dirt,
And heat the water so he can take a bath,
After all, cleanliness is the path.

He even asked for a golden goblet to sip,
That will make his guest remember the drip,
Of all the good times that they had,
From the present that the Phaeacians gave, not bad.

After his meal, there will be singing that follows,
Like a concert, there's no need to borrow,
It's his way of showing gratitude,
For the kindness he received, no attitude. 

So let us all learn from this story,
To be kind and show our glory,
To the guests that knock on our door,
A simple act can make them feel they're worth more!

"Yo, come over and take a seat,
I got some gifts for you to keep.
We got some hot water, so get in the tub,
And let it warm you up, cuz you need some love.

I packed up some gold and clothes so fly,
Don't worry 'bout a thing, just try 'em on, give it a try.
I even threw in a shirt from Alcinous, so soft and neat,
Together with a cloak that'll make you look elite.

So come on, don't be shy, take what you need,
And let me know if there's anything else you'd like to receive.
Sit back, relax, let the hot water do its thing,
And don't forget to thank the Phaeacians, the real MVPs of the scene."

Yo, check the lid yourself and lock it tight, 
Wrap the whole thing up, keep it out of sight.
Don't wanna get robbed, better stay alert,
Sleeping on your ship, you could get hurt.
Like Drake said, "I'm upset", if you lose it all,
So keep your eyes peeled and stand tall.

Oh dang, Ulysses was ready to chill
He locked up the chest, no one getting in for a thrill
Circe taught him how to seal it real tight
And he loved the warm bath after a long flight

No one to care for him since he left Calypso's pad
But her love was so strong he felt like a god
His servants washed and oil anointed
Got him fresh clothes, he wasn't disappointed

Then he bounced to the party, feeling pretty fly
Nausicaa saw him walk by, couldn't help but sigh
"Don't forget me, stranger, once you're home!
I saved ya once, so give me a shout on the phone!"

Yo Ulysses, let me hype up your story,
With internet slang and a reference to Cory!
Nausicaa, the daughter of Alcinous, so fine,
Saved you from danger, and that was really divine!

Oh mighty Jove, husband of Juno supreme,
Please let Ulysses reach his home and his dream.
For Nausicaa, his guardian angel he'll praise,
And bless her all his days in so many ways.

She saved him and was really quite cool,
A true goddess, like Lana Del Rey's pool.
So let's give a shout out to Nausicaa,
For saving Ulysses, hooray, hoorah!

As Ulysses spoke, he knew it was key, 
To show Demodocus love and respect like the G.O.A.T, 
For he knew, with his songs, the bard had a way to evoke, 
Emotions from the listeners, and make them feel woke.

The juicy pork was given to the musician in haste, 
A prize fit for a king, nothing goes to waste, 
Demodocus gladly ate the meal with joy, 
For his music had made the King's heart buoy. 

As the night went on, the bard played his lyre, 
Inspiring stories that set hearts on fire, 
Ulysses listened to the songs sung by Demodocus, 
So entranced, he did not care about the fuss.

With music that spoke of war, heroes, and passion, 
He felt a connection, a kinship, a worthy companion, 
The power of song is what makes us alive, 
For in Demodocus' hands, music thrived.

Yo Demodocus, you're the real deal,
Your storytelling skills are lit like a meal.
I bet you're tight with the goddess of the arts,
And bros with Apollo, who shoots arrows with his darts.

Your song about the Achaeans' strife,
And their journey back to their life,
Was fire, no cap, can't deny,
It brought tears to our eyes, don't lie.

But now, let's switch to a new verse,
About the Trojan horse, which was a curse,
Epeus and Minerva made it dope,
And Ulysses used it to give Troy a smoke.

If you tell it right, with swag and flair,
We'll let the world know, your rhymes are rare,
Your talent's so high, it reaches the sky,
Keep singing, and we'll never say bye.

Yo, gather round and hear this tale,
Of Trojans, Argives, and a horse so frail.
The Argives crept inside its walls,
Waiting for when Troy would fall.

The Trojans sat and went "hmm",
Should we destroy it or offer it to our gods as plum?
Their indecision was their fate,
For the Argives stormed out in a rage so great.

They pillaged the city without any care,
Ulysses and Menelaus were a deadly pair.
Deiphobus' home was where they struck,
And with Minerva's help, they had all the luck.

This story of war and cunning plans,
Proves that deceit can fall in the enemy's hands.
But let's be real, that Trojan horse,
Would have been nothing compared to Chuck Norris.

#TrojanWar #argives #Troy #Minerva #ChuckNorris

"Hey, Ulysses, don't you cry,
It's okay to feel emotions high.
Like a woman who mourns her man,
Weeping as much as she can;

But don't worry, we have your back,
No one here will give you flack.
Alcinous hears you loud and clear,
So don't hold back, my dear!

Now let's hear more of your tale,
Don't let your spirit grow stale.
We'll listen as long as you speak,
And your story, we'll never leak."

Ay, ay, Phaeacians, hear what I say
Demodocus's song ain't the way
Our guest is cryin' and feelin' blue
So let's all stop and think it through

We had a feast, ate till we were full
But our guest's heart is anything but cool
He's clearly in some kind of pain
So let's not make things harder again

These festivities are all for his sake 
So we gotta give and not just take 
We know it ain't easy being a stranger
So let's show some love and not be a danger

Treat our guest right, make him feel at home
We should always welcome those who roam
So stop the song, let's change up the tone
And make sure that our guest never feels alone.

#NoMoreDemodocus #BeACoolHost #HospitalityIsKey

"Yo dude, spill the tea and don't be coy, just tell me your name, country, and where you call home. My boys here got ships that own the sea, and they'll take you where you need to be. These ships don't need a rudder to steer, they know where to go, don't you fear. But hold up, my dad once predicted a wreck, with Neptune angry about our easy escort. He promised to bury our city under a mountain if we don't change our ways - scary AF, am I right, baybay?"

Yo, spill the tea and don't be shy,
Where'd you wander and which lands did you fly?
Tell us about the people and their towns,
Who was rude and who deserved crowns.
Share why you're sad about the Danaans' return,
Did you lose a kin that made your stomach churn?
Did you lose a G, a father-in-law, or your son,
A good friend that made your heart come undone?

Hey there, let me tell you a tale
About something that's sure to prevail
It's juicy, it's wild, it's hot off the press
And it'll have you saying "OMG, yes!"

So picture this, it's a total flex
A celeb couple, you know, one of the best
They were caught on camera, getting cozy in the park
And let me tell you, it's a whole new spark

The internet is buzzing with excitement
People are saying it's better than any enlightenment
And with the memes rolling in like crazy
This story is so good, it's even making me feel hazy

It's the talk of the town, on everyone's minds
The kind of thing that leaves us all behind
And as the story continues to unfold
I can guarantee, it won't get old

So keep your eyes peeled, and stay up to date
This story is sure to captivate
And let me warn you, it's not for the weak
This kind of gossip is something you seek.

BOOK IX

Yo, King Alcinous, your bard's voice is divine,
A whole crowd dancing and singing, it's so fine,
The table's loaded with meat and bread galore,
And the cupbearer serves wine, more and more.

But you wanna hear my story, my sorrows and pain,
Rekindling my memories, it's hard to contain,
The heavens struck me down, it's hard to express,
I don't know how to start, or how to progress.

It’s a tale of woe, of heartache, and despair,
It puts a strain on my soul that's hard to bear,
It’s a weight on my chest, causing me to cower,
I feel the wrath of the gods, it’s my darkest hour. 

But I'll tell my tale, through tears and through grief,
I'll rhyme and I'll meme, bring some relief,
And even though it hurts, and makes me frown,
I'll tell my story, through ups and downs.

Oh boy, let me hype up this story, so you won't be sorry!
First and foremost, let me introduce myself,
My name is Ulysses, the greatest of stealth!
Ithaca is my home, a place where forests bloom,
Neritum's high mountain, shining like the moon!
My island's surrounded by Same and Dulichium,
Plus the cool Zacynthus that we cannot do without!
It's true, Calypso and Circe wanted my heart too,
But nothing beats my country, I had to see it through!
My journey back home from Troy had dangers galore,
With Jove's will, adventures to keep; not ONE, but MORE!

Yo, listen up, story time's begun,
About a wild adventure that was quite fun.
Odysseus and his men set sail with ease,
To the city of the Cicons, without a sneeze.

They started sacking the town, pillaging their goods,
Living fast and free, like good fellas should.
But the men, they got drunk and lost their wits,
Drinking wine and killing sheep under the night's blitz.

The Cicons's armies, they came in thick,
With spears and chariots that made them quick.
Odysseus and his men fought with all their might,
But the gods weren't on their side that night.

These Cicons were too tough, stronger in the fight,
They had the upper hand with all their might.
So the men had to flee, with their tails between their legs,
Leaving their poor dead friends behind, under the night's yegs. 

Odysseus is a legend, but he'll sadly rue,
That day when his men didn't listen, and they fell through.
But it's all good, 'cause in the end he'll rise,
Into the sunset, with his men by his side, so wise.

Yo, so we sailed with sorrow in our hearts,
Thankful to have escaped death but torn apart,
Lost our comrades, each one a G,
We honored them with three invocations, you see?

Then Jove rose up and sent a North wind,
A hurricane that made us feel chagrined,
Land and sky were hidden in a thick veil,
Night came out of nowhere, our souls we did ail.

While our ships moved ahead with might,
The wind shredded our sails, oh what a sight,
Fearing shipwreck, we let them fall,
And rowed to land as our rescue call.

For two days and two nights, we stayed still,
Suffered toil and stress, no sign for thrill,
But come the third day, we raised our sails again,
Wind and steersmen took charge, oh amen!

I would've reached home, no harm done,
But the North wind and currents made sure it wasn't fun,
The Cape Malea was tough to double, you know,
Ended up near Cythera, high and low.

Yo, listen up, this tale's legit,
It starts with winds that wouldn't quit,
For nine long days we sailed the sea,
'Til on the tenth, land came to be.

The place was filled with flower food,
It tasted great, put us in the mood,
To stay with Lotus-eaters chill,
And never leave, just eat our fill.

But I knew better, had to act,
Before we lost the will to go back,
I dragged my crew, despite their tears,
And had them tie themselves to the piers.

Then I commanded them to row,
Don't let the Lotus-eaters' food glow,
Keep rowing 'til we reach our home,
Don't be lured by the flower's dome.

So they obeyed, and we set sail,
Avoiding the Lotus-eaters' tale,
And though we faced the ocean's roar,
We made it back to our own shore.

Yo, listen up, here's a story 
'Bout some Cyclopes, they're quite gory 
Living on grapes and barley 
They're a wild bunch, a bit gnarly 

They don't plant or plow the land 
Trustin' providence, they think it's grand 
No laws, no assemblies to go 
Just livin' in caves, don't you know? 

Each one's a master, a lord in his house 
No care for neighbours, they're as quiet as a mouse 
Wild grapes give 'em wine, what a feat 
But watch out for their ways, they'll be hard to beat 

So if you ever venture their way 
Be ready for trouble, come what may 
Cuz these Cyclopes are wild and bizarre 
Your own Odyssey, go risk, go far!

Yo, listen up, let me tell you a tale
'Bout an island so lit it'll make you exhale
It's filled with goats, not a human in sight
No plows, no ships, just wilderness and might

The Cyclopes live there, they've got no boats
No way to travel or stay afloat
They'd take the island, it's fertile and fresh
A perfect place to plant and thresh

Vines and grapes would grow like a dream
Level land for ploughing, nothing extreme
The grass is luscious, perfect for grazing
You could chill on the shore, completely amazing

No need for cables or anchors to use
Just beach your vessel, it won't be a ruse
There's even a spring and poplars close by
Water so clear, it'll make you sigh

So now you know about this awesome place
Wild goats, good land, and clear space
You won't find people, just the Cyclopes crew
But I promise you'll love it, just like they do! 
#IslandVibes #FertileGrounds #Wilderness

Oh my, this is one crazy tale,
We sailed the ocean without fail,
With no moon, stars or light,
We sailed into the darkness of the night.

A thick mist surrounded us all,
We couldn't see the island and it was quite the downfall,
We had no idea how close we were,
We couldn't see anything and it caused quite a stir.

Finally, we beached our ships with care,
Took down the sails and began to prepare,
We camped on the beach until the dawn,
Waiting to see what the new day would spawn.

This adventure was one for the books,
But we were lucky, we didn't overlook,
The importance of staying calm and acting quick,
Even when the night got real thick.

Yo, when the sun came up like rosy Don,
We hit the island and had some fun,
Nymphs brought goats to cook up with care,
And we split in groups, a hunting we dare!

We grabbed our bows and sharp spears,
And shot at goats, but no need to fear!
We got nine goats, and some got ten,
All day we ate, no worries back then!

We looked at the Cyclops' lair,
And saw the smoke in the air,
Almost heard them and their goat herd,
But we fell asleep without any word.

Next morning, it was time to convene,
So I gathered my crew and spoke with a keen,
What should we do, oh my sea friends?
That was the start of this wild adventure that never ends!

Yo, squad, stay put and chill, while I go on a thrill, 
My ship and I will go ahead and divvy up the hill,
I gotta see if they are kind or a bunch of savages,
Let's hope they're not uncivilized, nor remotely average. 
I'll explore their turf to determine their hospitality,
Are they humane or just a bunch of rats in reality?
Lemme do this on my own, I don't need a crew,
I will take on this journey anew.

Yo, listen up, this is no lie
We hit the sea and started to row, oh my!
We saw a cave with laurel trees
And a huge yard for goats and sheep with ease

It was the home of a monster, a sight to see
Who was away from home, maybe sipping tea
He looked nothing like a regular human face
But more like a crag, standing with grace

This creature's life was all abut the outlaw game
And he had a huge reputation for having no shame
So we waited for him to come back
Ready to attack in case of attack 

This place was wild, and nothing was sure 
But we had each other, our courage, and our love to endure 
So we waited and plotted, and hoped for the best 
With our hearts beating strong inside our chest. 

And that's when we saw him come back home 
Chilling out with his sheep, all alone 
Our adventure was about to begin 
As we prepared for the battle we were about to win. 

Like they say, "no risk, no reward" 
Our bravery was about to be explored.

Yo-ho-ho, I said "let's go",
Draw the ship ashore, and put on a show.
Our men stayed back, but the twelve best
Came along with me, no time to rest.

Maron, the priest, gave us a gift,
A goatskin of wine, a sweet, black lift.
We spared his life, and in return,
He gave us riches, what a burn!

Seven talents of gold, a silver bowl,
Sweet wine, unblended, my heart felt whole.
Nobody knew, but Maron and his wife,
How sweet it was, it could change your life.

I took a large skin, and filled it right,
With wine so sweet, it was love at first sight.
A wallet full of provisions, stand by,
Who knows what we'll face, we've got to stay spry.

We stepped in the cave, it was lit like the sun
But nobody's there, this isn't fun
We looked around, there's cheese galore
Lambs and kids, oh what a score
The dairy was full, with bowls and pails
But no one's here, no one prevails
My men wanted to steal, some cheese in a hack
But I had to meet the owner and talk the talk
He appeared, but dealing with him was no joke
It wasn't a good situation, my heart nearly broke

"We were chillin in his cave, feelin pretty brave
A sacrifice for his Cyclops taste buds we made
Munchin on cheeses, man they were great
Waitin for Cyclops, a dangerous date

He came in hot, with a load of wood to burn
We hid away, our stomachs churned
He brought in his sheep, all of them bleatin
Males outside, females awaitin milkin

He rolled a huge stone, no one could move
Protection from outsiders, his behoove
He milked his flock, then ate his meal
Half the milk for cheese, the rest for appeal

He spotted us there, we thought we were screwed
But we kept cool, didn't wanna be food
And then he said, with a deep growl rumble
Who the heck are you, interruptin my humble?"

Aye, aye, cap'n, you speak the truth,
But don't worry, we ain't no uncouth.
We're not rovers nor are we traders,
Just a crew with some #dope navigators.

We travel the world with the wind at our back,
With our #squad by our side, we never lack.
No hands against us, we're all about love,
Just some chill dudes, sent from above.

Our journey is long, filled with adventures untold,
But with our #lit crew, we'll never fold.
So don't worry about us, we come in peace,
Just some chill sailors, looking for a new lease.

Bro, we were shook by his monstrous look and yelling voice,
But I managed to blurt out, "Yo, we're Achaeans on our own choice!"
We were headed home from Troy, but thanks to bad weather and fate,
We got lost and now, my dude, we're in a crazy state.

We're the peeps of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, don't you know?
He's a legend all around the world, with a rep that steals the show.
With sacking such a huge city and killing loads of people,
He's got infinite renown, man, a legacy that's regal.

So, my dude, we're beggin' you for a bit of hospitality,
And maybe some presents, you know, for like a touch of civility.
But here's a warning, dude, from me to you, you'd better listen:
Jove protects us travellers, those who are desperate and missin'.

So, bro, show us some love and kindness, and we'll return the favor,
But if you don't, my dude, you'll have heaven's wrath to savor.
We're your supplicants, humbly asking for your aid,
And Jove is on our side, so don't you dare be afraid.

Yo bro, this Cyclops guy's speakin' real rude,

Talkin' smack and showin' no gratitude.

He's sayin' he don't fear no god,

Thinkin' he's tough, actin' like a fraud.

He's threatenin' to harm us all,

This giant's really big and tall.

He demands to know where we've docked,

Makin' his presence really felt and locked. 

But hold up dude, don't give in just yet,

Let's be slick and not get upset.

We'll keep our cool and think things through,

And hope that our ideas will come through too.

So let's not worry 'bout this giant's chat,

And pray to the gods, they'll have our back! 

(Insert meme: Cyclops blinking meme)

Oh dang, this dude's got some nerve
Trying to catch my homie in a curve
But my boy's too smart, he won't swerve
He'll give him a lie that he'll preserve

He said, "Neptune made our ship crash,
We were thrown onto rocks like trash."
And just like that, he made a quick dash
Out of that sticky situation, a clean pass

My dude is too quick to get caught
He's too smart, too sly, he can't be bought
His words are like gold, can't be taut
This guy just can't be stopped, what a thought

Oh my gosh, this story is insane,
I gotta hype it up or I'll go insane,
Odysseus and his crew were stuck in a bind,
Dealing with the Cyclops and his vicious grind.

The guy didn't even give a response,
He just picked up two dudes and dashed them in nonchalance,
It was like they were nothing but little puppies,
Blood and brains on the floor, what a sight so yucky.

Then the giant barbarian ripped them limb from limb,
Eating them up like they were sizzling hot Grimms,
Odysseus and his men were just lost and confused,
Crying and praying for a plan so they don't get used.

After dinner, the Cyclops took a little nap,
Lying in his bed surrounded by sheep in a snap,
Odysseus thought about killing him with his sword,
But then he realized they'd be trapped forevermore.

So they just sat there crying until the morning,
Hoping for a savior or some kind of warning,
This story's crazy, it's like a Greek tragedy,
With a monster that eats humans like it's some kind of delicacy.

Oh snap, when Dawn showed up with her rosy fingers,
Polyphemus, that Cyclops, was up to no good, lingers.
He lit his fire and milked his goats and ewes,
But then he snatched two men, and that's some fake news.

For breakfast, he decided to eat my guys,
Which was hella rude and not very wise.
Then he pushed the giant boulder with all his might,
And sent his sheep off, like it was just aight.

Now I'm stuck here, trying to concoct a plan,
To show this Cyclops guy who's the man.
I gotta have my revenge and make him pay,
Or it'll be just another wasted day.

Yo, here's the play, let me tell it in a new way.
This Cyclops dude had a huge club, I'm not playing, it was like a mast!
I told my boys, "grab that thing, let's make it bad-ass!"
We chopped off a piece, and sharpened it real nice,
Then hid it in some dung, which wasn't really a great spice.
We cast lots to choose who'd jab the Cyclops in the eye,
And the lucky four plus me became the squad to give it a try.
When the Cyclops returned, he got real crazy,
And drove all the sheep in, that's when things got hazy.
He milked his goats, let the young ones be,
But then he grabbed two guys, that wasn't cool, gee.
That's when I stepped up with my black wine in an ivy-wood bowl,
Ready to take down the Cyclops, now that's my goal.

"Yo, Cyclops, chill with the man meat,
Just try this drink, you won't be beat.
It's a drink-offering straight from my ship,
Take a sip, don't be hip.
Have compassion, don't be mean,
Show me the way, let's team up as a dream-team.
Your rage is cray-cray, you gotta calm down,
Otherwise, you won't be the talk of the town!"

Yo, this dude be thirsty and he's craving more,
He loves the flavor and he's ready to pour.
He's asking for my name, he wants to know who I am,
He wants to give me a gift, something lit like a hologram.

This wine tastes like nectar and ambrosia, oh boy,
It's like drinking from the gods, it brings so much joy.
Our soil grows grapes, but this drink's on another level,
It's got me feeling high, like I'm floating on a cloud like a rebel.

I'm about to take a sip and let it hit my soul,
It's so good that I can't control,
My taste buds are dancing, they're doing the yeet,
This wine is lit, it's got me feeling sweet.

So pass me another bowl, I'm ready to chug,
This drink is so good, it deserves a big hug.
And as I take a sip, I declare,
This wine is lit, it's beyond compare.

Yo, I gave him more wine,
Thinking, "This plan will be just fine."
Three times I filled up that bowl,
And he drank it up, like a drunk troll.

I saw that the wine had hit him hard,
I spoke persuasively with my guile card,
And said in a way that's so swell,
"My name is Noman, don't you smell?"

My folks and friends call me this way,
I hope you'll keep that in mind today.
Now give me what you promised, dear,
Or else you'll get a big ol' fear.

Oh my gosh, what a savage jerk!
He wants to eat up all the homies, like they're some kind of snack bar perk.
But he's got a plan, he's got it all figured out. 
Noman better watch out, or else he's gonna pout.

This dude is like the Grinch, stealing all the treats.
But instead of presents, he wants to munch on some meat.
He's a total villain, like Ursula or Jafar.
Noman's gotta run, he's gotta go far.

But hey, at least this clown's got jokes,
Thinking he's smart, thinking he's so woke.
But we know better, we know the truth,
Noman's gonna win, that's the proof.

As we battled the beast, he started to reel
Then fell on his face, what a raw deal
His neck hung back, he fell asleep
He was drunk on wine and flesh, so steep
We heated a beam, green and all
My men gained courage, ready to brawl
We thrust the beam into his eye, oh my
Turning it round, making him cry
Boiling blood bubbled over as we worked
His eye sputtered in the steam, so berserk
Like a blacksmith, we cooled it right
His eye hissed as we made our great flight
He threw the beam in a frenzy of pain
Yelling to other Cyclopes, what a strain!

Yo, Polyphemus, what's the sitch?
Why you making all that noise, acting like a witch?
Are your sheep getting stolen, bro?
Is someone trying to hurt you, or is it just a no-show? 

We can't sleep with all this commotion,
What's causing your emotions?
Don't let anyone be a fraud,
Or try to hurt you by force, that's just odd. 

Chill out, man, don't be so mad,
Let's keep things civil, no reason to be sad.
Just tell us what's going on,
And we'll help you all night long. 

Oh, and don't forget, it's not the end of the world,
Just like Harambe, we remember him unfurled.
But we gotta move on and stay strong,
Otherwise, we'll just get it all wrong.

Oh dang, Polyphemus in trouble, 
trying to sound off like a savage double. 
Talking bout Noman killing, 
But we all know his vision ain't thrilling. 

He's blind as a bat, 
probably thinking Noman is a rat. 
But TBH, he needs some glasses, 
or maybe some LASIK classes. 

He wants to seem tough, 
screaming all loud and gruff. 
But we all know he's just a clown, 
and Noman is about to take him down. 

So don't front and don't front, 
Polyphemus is just a stunt. 
He's about to get wrecked, 
Noman's skills gonna make him feel wrecked.

Yo hold up, let's talk about this
You're feeling ill? That's not bliss
It could be Jove, with his magical touch
But don't worry, just pray to your dad, it's not that much
Neptune's got your back, you can bet
He'll make sure you're not feeling upset
So take a break and rest for a while
Neptune's got this under his versatile style 
#GodlyAdvice #NeptuneKnowsBest #FeelingIllihad

Okay, so check it, after they left, I was straight chillin'
Thinking about how my plan had been so fulfilling
The Cyclops moaning, in so much pain
Feelin' around blindly, looking for his gain
He found the stone, movin' it with bare hands
Sat in the doorway, makin' his demands
Stretchin' his arms, trying to catch me sneakin' 
Thought I'd be dumb enough to do some sheep thievin'
I may be sly, but I ain't no fool
Maybe it's time to dip outta this school
But first, let me take a selfie with the sheep
Gotta let my followers know I've earned my keep

Yo, I'm hyped to tell you 'bout this guy
In a situation, real danger was nigh
He had to think, scheme, and plan
To save himself and his companions fam

This dude had to save his life, for real
The danger was huge, it made him feel
He came up with a plan that's slick
And let me tell you, it was quite sick

He had some male sheep, black and grown
He bound them together, all on their own
With withies, on which the beast used to snooze
He made them silent, without any clues

Each sheep trio had a man inside
They covered him up, keeping him out of sight
Three sheep to each man, safe and sound
Protected from the monster all around

As for himself, he chose the finest ram
He held on tight, like in a raft he swam
Under its belly, he made a cozy bed
Holding on its fleece, keeping his head

"Yo, little sheep, why you tryna leave?
You should stick around and chill with me.
I'll pet your fleece and give you treats,
You'll be the coolest sheep on these streets!

But wait, what's this? Something's not right,
There's something hiding from my sight.
Under your belly, oh what a trick,
These darn mortals are making me sick!"

So Polyphemus, in his rage,
Locked up the men inside his cave.
But they were smart and had a plan,
To escape and flee from the giant man.

With their wits and some wooden beams,
They blinded him and lived out their dreams.
And so they escaped the island of woes,
Thanks to their smarts and quick-thinking blows.

Yo, what's up, cool ram?
Why you actin' like a slam?
You're always the first to run,
Now you're just makin' me feel undone.

Is it 'cause you know your master's in pain,
And that Noman's crew is the one to blame?
You want revenge for what they did,
And make them pay for their misdeed.

If you could talk, you'd tell us where they hide,
And we'd make them suffer and feel our pride.
We'd squeeze their head and make them scream,
Until we're sure they'll never scheme.

So don't you worry, cool ram,
We'll get Noman and his clan.
We'll bring them down and make them pay,
And you'll be free to run and play.

Yo, Odysseus my man, you're quite the genius, 
Under a ram's belly, you got really serious. 
You freed your crew, and drove the sheep fast,
The Cyclops lurking, you made your escape last.

Your comrades wept, for those who had been slain,
But with nodding and frowning, you made them restrain.
The sheep were boarded, the crew on their seats,
And they stroke through the sea with swift fleet beats.

With a voice that echoed, you taunted the beast,
The Cyclops, he heard, he was full of unease.
Your cleverness proved, danger you could tame,
With style, grace and bravery - Odysseus, you got fame.

Yo, Cyclops, bro you messed up bad,
Eating others like it's just a fad,
You should've known what was coming,
Now the gods have got you running.

You ate them up, just like a snack,
In your cave, no turning back,
But your sin found you, that's for sure,
And now you're facing a mighty lure.

Jove and the gods, they punished you,
For doing something cruel and untrue,
You should have learned right from wrong,
And now you're singing a different song. 

So take this as a lesson learned,
Next time, think before you get turned,
And don't forget, what goes around comes back,
Now it's time to face the fact.

Yo, listen up, this tale I'll spin
Of a sailor who faced a Cyclops with a grin
He spewed his braggadocio without caution
But the monster was filled with rage and frustration

He grabbed a mountain and threw it with might
The sea shook in terror at the sight
The wave it caused propelled them back
Closer to land, on a dangerous track

The sailor grabbed his trusty pole
And guided them away from the rocky shoal
But he wanted to taunt the beast some more
His men were scared and begged him to ignore

The tale of this sailor is wild and insane
But his bravery and boldness remains
To face impossible odds with courage and pride
Is what Gen-Z and Millenials want to see and abide

Yo, hold up, chill for a sec,
Don't get this beast all riled and wrecked,
He's already thrown a rock and made us flee,
We're lucky to be alive, don't you agree?
If we keep talking, he might grab a boulder,
And crush our skulls, our brains he'll smolder,
Let's keep it hush, keep it on the low,
Or we'll be tweeting "RIP" like it's a sorrowful show.

Oh dang, it's getting lit up in here  
Ulysses, this dude's got no fear!  
Talking smack to a Cyclops so strong,  
It's like he's playing Fortnite all day long.  

"I put out your eye," Ulysses said with conviction,  
Making the Cyclops filled with affliction.  
But Ulysses wasn't phased at all,  
He's a hero, gotta stand tall.  

He told the Cyclops to drop his act,  
Or else his booty, he'll smack.  
With his squad by his side,  
He's ready to take on this one-eyed guy.  

Cyclops ain't got nothing on Ulysses,  
His rhymes are cold, while the Cyclops freezes.  
So next time someone asks him who,  
Remember, it was Ulysses that made him say "Boo!"

Dang, Polyphemus, that's a major bummer
Your prophecy's come true, then you're a goner
Telemus was right, he saw it coming
Ulysses may be small, but he's quite cunning

You thought it'd be a big, beefy guy to take you down
But it was Ulysses who made you frown
Now you wanna give him presents and be hospitable
And urge Neptune to make his journey feasible

Neptune's your dad? That's pretty rad
Maybe he'll help Ulysses and you won't be so sad
He's the only one who can cure your plight
So maybe it's time to make things right

Keep Calm and Welcome Ulysses in,
Polyphemus, the cyclops with a chin

Oh dang, this story's got some spice,
Talking epic battles, not so nice,
Our hero's laying down the diss,
Wishing his foe was sent to the abyss.

Neptune won't save you, that's for sure,
With that bad eye, you're just a blur,
Our protagonist don't hold back,
Telling his enemy they're about to face a smack.

Hades, oh Hades, god of the dead,
Some may say it's where you'll be led,
This story's got some serious heat,
Makes my heart skip a beat. 

But let's get real, let's not forget,
Memes and slang, they're a safe bet,
So let's keep it fresh, let's keep it lit,
This story's got me feeling legit.

Yo, this story got me quite alarmed,
Homer's Odyssey has got me charmed,
The hero with a never-ending quest,
Facing monsters and gods with no time to rest.

Poseidon drew his weapon out,
He wanted to drown Ulysses, no doubt,
But the hero prayed with fingers crossed,
And asked Great Neptune not to leave him lost.

Let him return to his home, his love,
But make it tough, like climbing above,
Give him trials, give him strife,
But let him return with a new life.

This story has us on the edge,
Like watching our boy's snapchat story dredge,
Will Ulysses make it home and find peace?
Or face further battles with no release?

Yo, this dude prayed up to Neptune,
Asked for some help, Neptune didn't swoon,
He picked up a rock that was real heavy,
Swung it real hard, it was surreal, man it was trippy!

The rock missed the ship by a hair,
But the rudder was super close to despair,
And the sea shook, just like a quake,
The waves went wild, it was no fake!

The waves pushed us closer to the shore,
We were headed for an adventure, that's for sure,
This story is getting so lit, so hype,
Like Drake said, we're going zero to a hundred, right?

Yo! We finally reached the island, no longer alone,
Our comrades full of sorrow, waiting by their phone.
We beached our ship and landed on the shore,
Divvied up the sheep, no one feeling sore.

The Cyclops' flock, all safe in our possession,
We split it even, no need for confession.
But one special ram, all said it should be mine,
So I sacrificed it, with a prayer that was divine.

Jove, the boss of gods, should have been pleased,
But his attention's elsewhere, his anger not eased.
He wants to take down both my ship and crew,
But with teamwork, resilience, we'll break through.

Alright, alright, gather 'round and hear my tale,
It's epic, trust me, like a viral viral hashtag on sale!
Our bellies were full on meat and drink,
Till the sun went down and night did blink.

We camped upon the scenic beach,
Chillaxin' under the sky like a peaceful leech.
The next morn' hit us like a dart,
Feelin' fresh, our crew was ready to start.

My men and I set sail like true warriors,
Rowin' in sync, cuttin' waves like popular YouTubers.
Our spirits lifted although our hearts were sore,
Lost comrades behind, leaving us somber to the core.

Oh snap, let me tell you a tale,
About something that's gonna make you wail.
It's crazy, like no cap,
And it all happened on the internet, just like that.

So I was scrolling through my feed,
Chilling like a boss, doing my deed.
And then I saw it, it was the tea,
A new meme that was lit AF, can't you see?

I clicked on it and it was fire,
Got me laughing so hard, I almost expired.
I had to share it with the crew,
And we all had a good laugh too.

But then, all of a sudden, what do I see?
Someone commenting, trying to come at me.
I had to clap back, no hesitation,
And put them back in their place, with no reservation.

It was savage, it was brutal,
But sometimes you gotta be mutual.
And that's how I learned a lesson, my friend,
The internet is wild, you better comprehend.

BOOK X

Yo, so we sailed on over to Aeoli Island,
Home of Aeolus, son of Hippotas, god-enlightened.
A wall surrounds the place, iron-bound and strong,
The air filled with cooking meat all day long.

Six daughters and six sons, all living happily,
Married together, but no need to get sappy.
They feast and chill, enjoying all kinds of stuff,
Sleeping at night, wrapped up tight, feeling plush.

The scent of meat is enough to make you groan,
But the island is legit - a vibe of it's own.
We were pumped to meet these hospitable folks,
Ready to party and have fun with jokes.

So check it out, y'all ready to hear
'Bout this dude Aeolus, the wind-man of the year?
He asked me 'bout Troy, the Argives and the Greeks,
And I told him everything without no sneaks.

When it was time for me to jet,
He didn't hesitate or make me sweat.
Instead, he helped me out with no complaint,
And made me a wind-sack, it was just too quaint.

This sack held the winds, each and every one,
For he was boss of them, his job was never done.
He put it on our ship, and sealed it up tight,
So that no breeze could cause us any fright.

He let the West wind go, with no delay,
But our own mistakes led us to go astray.
Don't mess with the wind-man, that's what I learned,
Or you might just end up, crashed and burned.

Yo, yo, yo, listen up, y'all, let me tell you a tale,
Of the Odyssey crew that sailed without fail.
They journeyed for nine long days and nine wild nights,
And woke to see their homeland in sight.
Odysseus was tired, in need of a nap,
He fell asleep and let go of the rudder, oh snap!
The men got to gossiping, and what did they think?
That Odysseus was hiding some treasure in his ink.
They praised his steez and how he made friends with all,
While they returned home, empty-handed and small.
But they wanted to prove that Odysseus was concealing,
Gold and silver in the bag they were stealing.
Let's see what he has, they all said with wide eyes,
Quick, before he wakes and it becomes their demise.

Dang, that's bleak and sad,  
like waking up to find mom mad.  
Evil counsel ruled the talk,  
they loosed the sack like a ghost and stalk.  
The wind howled forth, a storm did brew,  
took us weeping, away from our own crew.  
Caught in the moment, unsure what to do,  
whether to jump or just make it through. 
But you rode that wave, took a stand,  
covered up and held your own, man.  
The men cried out as the wind did fling,  
back to Aeolian island, out of the sting.

Yo, listen up, here's a story,
'Bout a man who sailed in glory,
Ulysses was his name,
Sailing to Ithaca, his ultimate aim.

He and his men went on shore,
To replenish supplies and more,
Aeolus he sought to see,
For his help to sail wild and free.

A feast was in full swing,
Aeolus' family had everything,
Ulysses sat as a supplicant,
On the threshold, he was hesitant.

They asked in surprise,
'What brings you here, tell no lies,
Has some god been unkind,
And has made you lose your mind?'

They had helped him before,
And wished to do so even more,
But Ulysses had made a mistake,
And his punishment was hard to take.

Oh dang, this is sounding grim,
Our boy in trouble, prospects dim,
He's talking 'bout his crew, they slept,
And now for him, things ain't looking hep.

His friends gotta help, he's in despair,
Wants them to fix this mess, if they dare,
It's hard out here, but they got this,
No need to trip, no need to diss.

They've got the power to turn it 'round,
Take their bro from lost to found,
Let's hope they step up and make it right,
Before it's too late and day turns to night.

OMG, I told them my feels,
but the dad said "bye" no appeal,
Called me "vilest of mankind",
and sent me packin' I couldn't unwind.
I was abhorred of heaven,
Left with nothing but tears no leaven,
This situation was a total loss,
Father was colder than a Polar Boss.

Yo, listen up, there's a tale to be told
Of a crew and their journey, so bold
They sailed and rowed, for many a day
But no wind came to guide their way

Six days and nights, they did not rest
Rowing, working, giving it their best
Until they arrived, at the city so big
Of the Laestrygonians, who were quite trig

Their ways were strange, and quite unique
Where shepherds worked both day and week
With double wages, they could earn
By milking goats and tending to cattle, so stern

But beware, for danger lurks in this land
The Laestrygonians, mighty and grand
They're giants, tall and fierce as can be
And they'll turn any sailors, into their tea

So let us continue, our adventure grand
As we explore this land, oh so grand
With perils and obstacles, at every turn
The journey ahead, we have to learn. #SailorLife #GiantDanger #HerdingDreams

Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum,
We landed in the harbour, but it was totally dumb.
The cliffs towered high, and the entrance was narrow,
But my badass captains sailed through like there was no tomorrow.

We moored our ships close, for the wind was dead calm,
And I climbed up high to see if there was any harm.
But alas, no sign of life, only smoke rising from the ground,
So I sent two of my crew to check and look around.

Were they bandits or rebels, jolly or mean?
What sort of people lived on this curious scene?
We didn't know much, but our curiosity was lit,
And we were hoping for some memes or at least some good sh...rimp cocktails to eat.
